        <p class="SectionTitle">Overview</p>
        <p class="SectionDesc">A menu is a file driven multi-level list of options that can be selected by an operator. Dynamo Tools includes four types of menus that can be easily customized</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Character based</li>
            <li>Dynaweb based (HTML)</li>
            <li>Dynascan based (for hand-held computers)</li>
            <li>Application Menus - used within an application to select a specific option.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Character Based</b>
        </p>
        <p>The menu processor includes a series of programs that display a menu of choices for the operator.&#160; It also provides automated functions to simplify application programs.&#160; The menu processor also provides security, restricting access to menus and selections on a menu based on login id.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Main Menu" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="System Selector" />Each menu has a three character menu code that allows the operator to display any menu by entering the three letter menu code.&#160; A menu can contain up to 16 selections.&#160; Menus are often arranged in a hierarchy or multi-level outline format.&#160; Menu's normally have a parent menu, which is displayed when an operator exits the menu.&#160; The highest level menu is called the Main Menu, formerly System Selector, and is assigned the menu code SYS.&#160; Each menu option may be a program, a script, a command, or another menu.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Menu Maintenance" />Menus are maintained using Menu Maintenance (SMU).&#160; The following menu codes should not be used, since they are reserved for use by the module listed.  &#160;</p>

        <p>Dynascan Menus are character based, but designed for the smaller display of a hand held computer such as a Motorola MC9090 or a tablet. They are maintained on the SMU menu. The menu is displayed using the same character based menu program <a target="_blank">CDS001</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Application Menus</b>
        </p>
        <p>Application Menus are also character based, and are designed to present a list of options within a single application. Each option is invoked with a CALL. Application Menus are maintained on the SMU&#160;menu. Applications call program SW101 to display the application menu. Note the original Application Menu was maintained on the CWP&#160;menu and used program <a target="_blank">SW100</a> to display the menu.</p>
