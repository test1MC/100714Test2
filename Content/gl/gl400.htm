        <p>This application shows the operator the inventory that is currently in transit from one store to another or from the operator's office to a customer's branch based on a specified date. The listing will display the transfer order number, the shipping warehouse, the receiving warehouse, the reference, the order date, the ship date, the received date, and the shipped value. The operator can use this report to verify that every item listed is actually in transit or that all items that should no longer be listed as in transit have been removed. </p>
