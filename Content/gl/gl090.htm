        <p class="SectionDesc">The G/L Period Ending Date Maintenance program is used to set up the period ending date for each fiscal year and period.&#160; It is also used to open and close each accounting period. &#160;Dynamo 
	prevents posting transactions to a closed period; however, closed periods can be reopened by simply selecting that period.</p>
        <p>Typically, you will have 2 or 3 periods open at a time: the current period 
	and perhaps 1 or 2 prior periods as closing entries are being completed.</p>
        <h6>Note: Remember to close each period to prevent accidental postings to prior or 
	future periods.</h6>
        <p>In some cases, companies change from a non-calendar fiscal year to a 
	calendar based year.&#160; This may require a short year with fewer than 12 
	periods.&#160; If this occurs and the 4 digit year has already been used, 
	then you may place an alpha character after the year such as 2002A.</p>
