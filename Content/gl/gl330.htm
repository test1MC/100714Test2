	updated in error.</p>
        <p>Although many accountants may disagree with a program such as this which 
	can delete an updated posting, it can be useful when a posting has been made 
	with the incorrect posting date.&#160; <h6>Note: the posting is permanently 
	deleted and no transaction details will appear in G/L Inquiry nor the G/L 
	Transaction Report.</h6></p>
