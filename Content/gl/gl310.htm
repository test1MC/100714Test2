        <p class="SectionDesc">The G/L Posting Report functions like a daily transaction register.&#160; It details all Accounts Payable transactions that have taken place since the last G/L Posting Report Update.&#160;It also can be printed for a specific batch that was previously updated.</p>
        <p>Typically, this report would be printed after you have completed Accounts Payable processing for the day. &#160; Do not update this report until after printing and reviewing it for accuracy. &#160;Prior to updating, you may modify or delete an existing posting using <a href="gl320.htm">G/L Posting Entry and Maintenance</a> found on the G/L menu. &#160;Once the report is updated, this option is not available; however, you may use G/L Posting Entry and Maintenance to create a new posting, duplicate an existing posting, or reverse an existing posting.</p>

        <p>Transactions are listed in order of Posting Date, along with source code, batch number, G/L account number and description, type of transactions, invoice number (if applicable), and corresponding debit and credit amounts.</p>
        <p>After the G/L Posting Report is printed, you will be given the opportunity to update.&#160;&#160;If you have MAS90 installed, then this update will post to the MAS90 Daily Transaction Register, which can then be printed and updated to post to MAS90.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>In effect, we are posting to both the Dynamo and MAS90 General Ledgers.&#160;</p>
        <h6>Note that you must print this G/L Posting Report and update it before the transactions will appear on the MAS90 Daily Transaction Register.&#160;&#160;</h6>
        <p>Remember to make the change in both Dynamo and MAS90 when adding or changing General Ledger accounts.</p>
