        <p>G/L&#160;Posting Detail for IC&#160;Transactions is used to display a listing of general ledger postings Dynamo has made on the operator's behalf. The program views the Inventory Control transactions for the day (transfers, purchase orders, returns, inventory adjustments, etc.) and makes a posting of them automatically. The operator can use this report to determine if the application is working as expected; it will display if the operator made any typographical errors when entering transactions. The operator should run this application daily when first using Dynamo to make certain no errors or problems are arising. Once the operator has had Dynamo for a longer amount of time, he or she can run the application less frequently just to occasionally ensure that the postings are still running smoothly. The operator can also run this application for previous time periods to see if any postings were incorrect in a given time period. </p>
