        <p class="SectionDesc">Dynamo is an integrated application.&#160; This means that all transactions flow through to the Dynamo General Ledger without the need to make manual journal entries.&#160; This application is used to maintain many of the General Ledger account numbers that are used when posting to the General Ledger.</p>
        <p>Some G/L accounts can vary by G/L location, e.g., branch, warehouse, etc.&#160; Other accounts do not vary by location and only have one account that applies to then entire company.</p>
        <p>This application has four major categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sales, Accounts Receivable (A/R), Accounts Payable (A/P), and General Ledger (G/L) accounts</li>
            <li>Inventory Accounts</li>
            <li>Rental Accounts</li>
            <li>Special Purpose Accounts</li>
