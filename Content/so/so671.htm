        <p>With Sales/Profit Analysis Reports, the operator can analyze business performance based on customer, salesman, branch, warehouse, and/or company totals compared with month, year, or percent change. This application would typically be run at month's end. The reports can help your company decide which customers should be contacted, for instance, if they are purchasing less than they have been previously. </p>
