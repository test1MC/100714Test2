        <p class="SectionDesc">Note that both of the following programs require the operator to select the warehouse(s) of interest.</p>
        <h5>Sales Order Printing</h5>
        <p>This program allows the operator to print billing copies and packing lists for sales orders that are scheduled to print. Sales&#160;orders are only <i>scheduled</i> to print  if there were back-ordered items involved in the sale. Otherwise, sales orders are taken out of the print schedule if they are manually printed from <a href="so100.htm">Sales&#160;Order Processing</a>. </p>
        <p style="text-decoration: none;">Sales&#160;Order Printing can be useful when used along with the Back <a href="../ic/ic240.htm">Order Fill Report</a>, since it will print orders that are no longer back-ordered and given to the appropriate department for billing and order fulfillment. </p>
        <h5>Sales Order Printing - Credit Exceptions </h5>
        <p>This option is used to print sales orders for customers who are past due on previous invoices OR for customers who are over their credit limit. This application is similar to the Sales Order Printing application, except that it only prints sales orders for customers with these exceptions. The sales orders may be set aside to be reviewed by authorized employees—typically the Accounts Receivable or Accounting department—who can choose to void the orders, hold them until payment is made, or fill the order if a payment method is agreed upon. </p>
