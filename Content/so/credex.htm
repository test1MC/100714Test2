        <p>Sales Order Printing - Credit Exceptions is used to print sales orders for customers who are past due on previous invoices OR for customers who are over their credit limit. This application is similar to the Sales Order Printing application, except that it only prints sales orders for customers with these exceptions. The sales orders may be set aside to be reviewed by employees who can choose to void the orders, hold them until payment is made, or fill the order if a payment method is agreed upon. </p>
