        <p>This program allows the operator to keep track of the cash in a particular cash drawer.</p>
        <p>After choosing which drawer you'd like to balance (the default is selected in <a href="../xx/xxcw00.htm">Dynamo Parameter&#160;Maintenance</a>), you are prompted with several options.</p>
