        <p>Month End Update must be run each month after the last SOP Invoice Update has been run for a particular month AND before running the first SOP Invoice Update for the new month. Entry of new orders can be started as soon as the Order Booking Month has been changed.  Month End Update does not need to be run before entering orders for the new month. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note: Open sales orders can be invoiced and invoices can be printed for the new month prior to running Month End Update. But do not run SOP Invoice Update for the new month until Month End Update has been run which closes the last month. </p>
