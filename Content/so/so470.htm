        <p>If an operator's company has a pre-numbered list of order forms, with this program, the operator can assign starting sales order numbers, assign ending sales order numbers, or  delete any sales order numbers in between.  If the operator plans to use all of these orders, he or she should assign them. If a sales order has been voided or damaged beyond usability, the operator should delete that number. </p>
        <p>When selecting <a href="so480.htm">Print Unused Sales&#160;Order Numbers</a>, you can view which numbers you have available out of your assigned sales order numbers.  </p>
        <p>The operator must enter&#160;"A"&#160;to assign sales order numbers. </p>
