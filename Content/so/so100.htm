        <p class="SectionDesc">Sales Order Processing allows for the creation of new sales orders and for editing those previously entered. It also serves to create quotes, void previous orders, create a new sales order by duplicating a previous one, create an invoice, or initiate a customer return. When viewed in a list, orders are grouped by status code. Open sales orders (blank code) are displayed first, then closed orders (C), followed by Quotes (Q) and the voided orders (V). Within each status code grouping, orders are sorted chronologically by date, with the most recent appearing first. </p>

                        <p style="font-weight: normal;">This option is appropriate for the vast majority of point-of-sale retail transactions where a customer pays for an item in person and then takes it with them when they leave. Since there is generally no need create an invoice, get a purchase order number, or collect personal information from a customer in these cases, the operator will quickly bypass being prompted to enter such information and go directly to entering the items to be sold. Dynamo will assign a sales order number and create an invoice indicating the payment method and amount tendered.</p>

                    <td>
                        <p>This option is good for  transactions that do not involve a typical, in-person, retail sales transaction. Dynamo assigns a sales order number and, when the order is shipped an invoice will need to be created and sent to the customer. This option will prompt the operator for customer information since shipping products to a customer without prepayment generally requires the customer to have an account with a company.</p>

                        <p>A quote is used to inform a customer of the price they would pay if they choose to purchase the items listed on the quote. Moreover, creating a quote (instead of a sales order) will not take items out of inventory while the customer is deciding. Once the customer makes a decision regarding the quote, it can either be converted to a sales order—in which case the normal order-fulfillment process can proceed—or it can be voided, requiring no further action by either party.  It is worth noting that a quote will not include sales tax, but can include estimated shipping if it is manually entered by the operator under the <i>Shipping</i> option. </p>

Since searching this whole list can be cumbersome, Dynamo allow the operator to instead search for a customer using a number of unique identifiers. To narrow the search results, enter information related to the target customer such as customer number, company or contact name, email address, phone number, zip code.

Status codes are ordered, from first to last, with open orders (blank code) apearing first, followed by closed (C), quotes (Q), and finally voided orders (V). Within each status code, the orders will be sorted by date starting with the most recent first. Using the <i>Page Down</i> key will allow easy scrolling of multiple pages at a time.

If using a third-party software, such as UPS&#160;WorldShip, Dynamo can automatically populate this information when it becomes available. A hand-held scanner may also be employed to transmit the tracking information to  Dynamo.</p>

Choosing <i>Authorize&#160;Only</i> will place a hold on the card for the payment amount. This can be useful when the exact total is not known at the time of sale, allowing the payment amount to be changed later to an amount up to—but not exceeding—the payment amount. When the exact total is known, the payment amount can be changed and the transaction will be finalized by choosing <i>Charge Card Now</i> for the new dollar amount.
