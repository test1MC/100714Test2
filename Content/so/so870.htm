        <p>Sales&#160;Tax Reporting is used to print or upload information about a company's sales for Ohio sales tax purposes. The information displayed provides details necessary for the Ohio tax website. </p>
        <p>You must indicate the starting month &amp; year, the branch code, the taxpayer ID, and the vendor license number. If you want to upload this information directly to the Ohio Sales Tax reporting website, view the Ohio Upload File Name. Upon logging into the website, the operator can upload the information by locating the upload file name that was given in Dynamo. The information is formatted in the manner required by the state of Ohio, which allows for easy upload. Currently, this function is only supported for Ohio companies. </p>
