        <p class="SectionDesc">Software from Excellware and others who base their application software on the Excellware System Management Software is licensed for use based on the number of simultaneous operators.</p>
        <p>An operator is roughly defined as a login session with some exceptions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiple sessions from the same personal computer using the FacetWin terminal emulator only count as a single operator. Multiple sessions from a personal computer using any other terminal emulator will count as multiple operators.</li>
            <li>Multiple sessions from the console on a system running SCO OpenServer 5 only count as a single operator.</li>
            <li>The Excellware Web Management Software as executed by a web server, counts as a 
	single operator, regardless of the number of web processes running.</li>
            <li>The Dynamo Fax Option requires an operator license to update the fax status.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can purchase additional operators at any time by contacting your software provider. &#160;Installation of additional operators is done by a brief telephone call to Excellware using the Update License Control Information option on the System Management Configuration (SMC) menu.</p>
        <p>The license is transferable to any replacement computer, but not to another company or entity.</p>
        <h5>New Installations</h5>
        <p>You will be prompted for a License Control Number. &#160;You can obtain this number from your software provider or Excellware. &#160;You will need to call Excellware to complete the licensing process where you will be given an authorization number to enter.</p>
        <h5>Replacement Server</h5>
        <p>All files can be transferred to the replacement server without 
	limitation.</p>
