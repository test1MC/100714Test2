        <p class="SectionDesc">Please provide the following information to your forms 
	provider when ordering Dynamo Accounts Payable checks: &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>The check and stub are printed on 8 1/2 x 11 paper. The paper should be perforated in two places running the width of the paper.</p>
        <p>Perforate the paper 4" from the top. The top third of the paper should be left completely blank; eliminate all pre-printing, 
	even the check number. This top stub should be stapled to an invoice copy and retained for your files.</p>
        <p>The paper should also be perforated 7 1/2" from the top. This middle stub should also be left completely blank; eliminate all pre-printing, 
	including the check number. This remittance advice will be mailed with the check to the vendor.</p>
        <p>The check itself should be printed on the bottom third of the paper in your traditional check color or shading. Pre-print these check areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Company logo (optional)</li>
            <li>Company Name and Address</li>
            <li>"To the Order Of"</li>
            <li>Bank Name and Address</li>
            <li>Signature Line (bottom right)</li>
            <li>Check Number (printed sequentially)</li>
            <li>MICR Information (bottom of the check)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All other information will be printed by Dynamo.</p>
        <p>It is very important to specify the order in which the check forms should be packed. Your check provider can stack checks in a box in one of four ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Face up, lowest numbers on top</li>
            <li>Face down, lowest numbers on top</li>
            <li>Face up, highest numbers on top</li>
            <li>Face down, highest numbers on top</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The right sequence is determined by what kind of printer you have and what tray you will be using for printing checks. We know from experience, for example, that the HP2100 pull-down tray requires that the forms be placed in the printer face up, lowest number on top.&#160; We suggest you run some samples through your printer before ordering the check forms.</p>
        <p>You can order check forms from your usual form supplier or you may obtain a quote from the following suppliers who have 
	provided checks for us in the past:</p>
