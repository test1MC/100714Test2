        <p class="SectionDesc">The Payment Selection Register is a list summarizing all invoices that have been selected for payment.</p>
        <p class="SectionDesc">The invoices are listed alphabetically by the vendor's alphasort name. (Vendors with a credit balance will not appear on this Register. A listing of these vendors can be found on the A/P Ageing Report on the APR menu.)</p>
        <p>Normally this document is not retained as an accounting document but is used as a worksheet from which to make any necessary adjustments before the checks are printed.</p>
        <p>Usually a register is printed for only one batch at a time. However, for those customers who have several operators processing a large volume of payables, Dynamo supports multiple simultaneous payment selection batches.</p>
