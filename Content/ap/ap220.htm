        <p>The payment batch number and general ledger posting date prints at the top.&#160;Itemized information on the report includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check Number<br />    This column remains blank if the Payment Method was coded as T for Electronic Funds Transfer or W for Automatic Withdrawal because a printed check was not issued. &#160; The 'P' column will show these codes.</li>
            <li>Check Date<br />    This is the date that printed on the checks.</li>
            <li>Vendor Number and Name<br />    One-time vendors will have a single-character vendor number, such as M, followed by the Payee's name.</li>
            <li>P Column<br />      Payment Method Code:

      <ul><li>blank = normal</li><li>S = separate check</li><li>T = funds transfer</li><li>W = automated withdrawal)</li></ul></li>
            <li>Invoice Number, Date, and Amount</li>
            <li>Discount Amount (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Net<br /></li>
            <li>The check amount</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Amount/Discount/Payment columns will display a subtotal for all blank check numbers; that is, those payments that were made by Automated Withdrawal or Electronic Funds Transfer. &#160; This subtotal is included in the grand total of each column.</p>
        <p>A printed copy of the Check Register must be produced before the check information can be updated to the permanent files.</p>
