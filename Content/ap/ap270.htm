        <ol>
            <li>Print Summary Report of all vendors that are either currently coded to require 1099 forms or have one or more invoices that are coded for 1099s. &#160; The "other" columns on this report indicate other invoices to this vendor that are not coded for 1099s. Sample <a href="../examples/1099SummaryReport.pdf">summary report</a>. </li>
            <li>Print Detail Invoice Report to list the specific invoices not coded for 1099s. &#160; You can use the A/P Invoice Maintenance program on the A/P menu to modify the 1099 form status for any invoice. Sample <a href="../examples/1099DetailReport.pdf">detail report</a>. </li>
            <li>Summarize 1099 Data by Vendor.</li>
            <li>Maintain 1099 Data by entering a vendor and 1099 type. &#160; Descriptions of the 1099 boxes display by using the F2 key.</li>
            <li>Print 1099 Forms for all vendors or an individual vendor.&#160; Only laser forms are supported.&#160;Currently there is a separate form for each 1099 type (Dividend, Interest, or Miscellaneous).
