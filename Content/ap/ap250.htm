            <li><a href="#All%20Vendors%20with%20transactions">All vendors with transactions</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#Only%20vendors%20with%20a%20credit%20balance">Only vendors with a credit balance</a>

        </p>
        <h5><a name="All Vendors with transactions"></a>All Vendors with transactions</h5>
        <p>Selecting the first format provides a detailed list of current outstanding payables by vendor.&#160;Within a vendor, the invoices print in sequence by Due Date.  For each vendor, the report shows the invoice number, invoice date and due date, the number of days the invoice is past due (based on the current date), the invoice amount, discount, and balance due.</p>
        <p>This summary of outstanding payables will assist you in making payment decisions affecting future cash flow.</p>
        <h5><a name="Only vendors with a credit balance"></a>Only vendors with a credit balance</h5>
        <p>Selecting the second format provides a list of vendors who currently have a credit balance. The list includes invoice detail. &#160; The "Days" column provides a quick check to see how long this vendor has had a credit balance with you. If it is unlikely that you will be conducting business with this vendor in the future, you may wish to request that the vendor send you a check for the credit amount.</p>
