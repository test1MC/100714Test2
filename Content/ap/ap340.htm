        <p class="SectionDesc">The purpose of a A/P Trial Balance Report is to 
	reconcile any variation between the General Ledger Accounts Payable Account and the Accounts Payable detail as of a specific date.</p>
        <p>The report summarizes A/P activity AS OF an operator-specified date. &#160; Invoices and payments entered into the system after this date are excluded. A Trial Balance can be run for all vendors or an operator-specified vendor. &#160; Invoices listed include payments and invoice balance. Transactions in which all amounts are zero are not included in the report. Within each vendor, transactions print in invoice date, then invoice number sequence.</p>
        <p>Normally a Trial Balance Report is obtained for a current or recent month-end date; however, past dates are valid entries as well.</p>

        <p>For those companies who keep A/P data by location, a Trial Balance may be run for each location, an operator-specified location, or a consolidation of all locations.&#160; The Location option is not applicable for those companies with a single location.</p>
        <p>The total of all open invoices on the Trial Balance should match the total of the General Ledger A/P Total shown on the <a href="ap240.htm">Display A/P Ageing</a> screen.</p>
