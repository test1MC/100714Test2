        <p class="SectionDesc">It is important to review the Invoice Register for accuracy prior to Updating. &#160; By Updating the Invoice Register, the invoice entries will be added to the permanent files. &#160;</p>
        <p>Normally this review is accomplished by running an adding machine tape of all invoice totals. &#160; This total should equal the batch total on the Invoice Register. &#160; If the totals do not match, do not Update. &#160; Return to <a href="ap100.htm">Invoice Data Entry</a> to make necessary corrections, then reprint the Invoice Register.</p>
        <p>If the totals agree, proceed to Update. Batches that have not yet been updated will be displayed. &#160; Choose a batch to be updated by highlighting and pressing Enter.</p>
