        <p class="SectionDesc">Selecting this program causes the invoices that were set up in Recurring Invoice Maintenance to be scanned, and those that need to be generated by the operator-specified date are added to the invoice data entry batch. &#160; If the frequency of the recurring invoice is weekly, bi-weekly, or semi-monthly, multiple invoices may be generated during this process.</p>
        <p>You will be given the option to select an existing data entry batch to which these recurring invoices will be added or to create a new batch. <h6>Note: you must return to <a href="ap100.htm">A/P Invoice Data Entry</a> to modify or maintain a batch entry.</h6></p>
        <p>Generate Invoices Dated Through: The date you enter in this field depends on how often you generate invoices.&#160; The date you enter should ensure that all invoices which need to be generated will be included. For example, if you typically generate invoices on the 1st of the month (e.g. 5/1), you should Generate Invoices Dated Through: 5/31.</p>
