        <p class="SectionDesc">The Accounts Payable Ageing Display assists you in making payment decisions affecting future cash flow by presenting an overview of all ageing payables based on the "as of" date you request.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The display includes a range of 4 ageing categories for payables "due in" a number of days and 4 ageing categories for payables "past due" in a number of days. Payables are broken down by total dollar amount, number of payables, and percentage of total for each ageing category. Dollar amount and number of payables "on hold" are also displayed.</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the display you will see the General Ledger A/P account number and amount. This is provided as a "check and balance" between the Accounts Payable detail and the General Ledger posting. These two amounts should be equal. If they are not, perhaps a batch of checks have not been updated yet; it is during the update phase that posting to the General Ledger takes place.</p>
