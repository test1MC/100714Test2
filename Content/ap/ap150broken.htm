        <p>If the operator no longer wants to make a certain payment, it should be deleted before updating.</p>
        <p>This option is used to reverse a payment previously updated using 
		Check Update or a Manual Payment Update that has not yet cleared the 
		bank using Bank Reconciliation.</p>
        <p>You might need to reverse a payment if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>an invoice paid was for a different vendor</li>
            <li>you have stopped payment on the check</li>
            <li>you have decided not to pay one or more of the invoices at this 
			time</li>
            <li>an amount was entered incorrectly, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once a payment is reversed, any invoices paid will be re-opened and 
		can be paid again later.&#160; Use A/P Invoice Data Entry or A/P Invoice 
		Maintenance if you need to adjust or reverse completely any invoices on 
		the payment.</p>
        <p>Note that <a href="ap100.htm">Vendor Inquiry</a> (A/P Checks option) 
	will show the original payment as well as the reversed payment, coded with 
	an "R" in the Pmt column for Reversal.</p>
        <p><b>Why doesn't the payment I want to reverse appear in the list of reversible payments?</b> </p>
        <p>When the payment has already cleared the bank, it cannot be reversed in the same way as it is done before Bank Reconciliation. </p>
        <p>To rectify this situation, the operator must complete the following in a single manual payment batch:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter a new invoice to the incorrect vendor with a negative amount and process it as a payment (it cannot be processed as a check since checks cannot be negative).</li>
            <li>Run Manual&#160;Payment Update.</li>
            <li>Enter a new invoice to the correct vendor with a positive amount and process it as a payment. </li>
            <li>Run&#160;Manual Payment Update. </li>
            <li>In Bank Reconciliation, mark the two new payments as cleared. They will offset one another. </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Void check not used</h5>
        <p>
            <img src="ap150-9.png" style="width: 725px;height: 424px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that this is different from a payment reversal.</p>
        <p>This option is used whenever there is a check number that will not be 
		used -- for example, if you print a batch of checks, and <i>before 
		updating</i> discover one check is incorrect, and then delete the 
		payment using either A/P Check Maintenance or Manual Payment Entry.&#160; 
		The check# originally printed should be destroyed.&#160; In this case 
		you should use this option to record the fact that this check# will 
		never be used.&#160; Voiding a check is not required, but many 
		accountants want to account for every sequential check#.</p>
        <p>This option could also be used if a check was damaged or otherwise 
		not used.</p>
        <h5><a name="Transfer_funds"></a>Transfer funds</h5>
        <p>This option is used to transfer funds from one of your bank accounts 
		to another.</p>
        <p>You have the option to print a check, or to record a funds transfer 
		made online.</p>

        <p>This option is used to record a payment where you have payment data 
		in a file, such as what might be provided by a payroll service.&#160; Since a 
		payroll posting often includes many G/L account numbers and amounts, 
		importing a payment from a file can save time and reduce data entry 
		errors.</p>
        <p>The import file must be a comma or tab delimited file and stored on 
 the Dynamo server.&#160; You can access the default folder from a 
 Windows PC by clicking Start, Run and entering \\server\XX-shared where 
 XX is your two letter company code.&#160; Contact Excellware support if 
 you cannot view this folder from Windows.&#160; </p>
        <p>If using Microsoft Excel, open the spreadsheet file and click File, then 
	Save As.&#160; Change the 'Save as type' to 'Text (Tab Delimited) (*.txt)'.&#160; 
 This will save the spreadsheet file on the server in a format that can be 
 used by Dynamo.</p>
        <p>Prior to importing a payment for a vendor, use Vendor Maintenance to 
	specify the import column letters that will contain the G/L Account# and 
	Amount.&#160; You may also specify the Payment Date column, and optionally a

	payroll file that has one payment for net checks on one date, and taxes on 
	another.&#160; See Vendor Maintenance, Manual Payment Import view for additional details.</p>
