        <h6>Note: The Discount field is the only "amount" field that can be changed through Invoice Maintenance.</h6>
        <p>To make changes to the invoice amount or G/L account distribution, go to Invoice Data Entry, since this will create an adjustment to the General Ledger. (Refer to Invoice Data Entry documentation on "<a href="ap100.htm">Correcting Invoice Entries that Have Been Updated</a>".)</p>
        <p>Once a vendor has been entered, a prompt will give you the option to enter a specific invoice number OR to display a list of invoices by using the F2 key.</p>
        <p>Upon selecting a specific invoice, you will be prompted to select the field needing adjustment. For example, to release an invoice for payment that was previously put on Hold, enter the Hold field number and delete the previous entry.</p>
        <h6>Note: If an invoice has already been selected for payment and then a change is made through Invoice Maintenance (for example, a discount was entered), go to Payment Selection, clear the existing payment batch containing this invoice, and run it again.&#160;&#160;</h6>
        <p>The invoices will be rescanned and the adjustment will be recognized by the system.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
