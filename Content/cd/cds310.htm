            <li>Configures a fax modem to send, receive or both</li>
            <li>Creates or deletes a fax class called 'outgoing' when multiple fax

        <p>If using this option to Enable a fax modem, then return to the prior 
	display to verify that the fax modem remains in an enabled state.&#160; If 
	the modem cannot stay in an enabled state then power cycle the modem and try 
	again.&#160; If you are still unable to keep a fax modem in an enabled 
	state, <a href="http://www.excellware.com/index.php/about/contact-us/">contact Excellware</a> for assistance.</p>
        <p>If more than one fax modem is configured to Send Faxes, then this 
	application will create a fax class called 'outgoing' and assign each fax 
	modem configured to Send Faxes as a member of this class.</p>
        <p>If only one fax modem is configured to Send Faxes, then this application 
	will remove the 'outgoing' fax class, if it exists.</p>
        <p>This application will also set the default destination to either the 
	'outgoing' fax class, or the fax queue name of the fax modem configured to 
	Send Faxes.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>operators with an older version of the fax software may have a single screen 
	display as shown below.</p>
        <p>
            <img border="0" src="cds310-1.jpg" width="568" height="329" alt="" />
        </p>
        <h5>There are 3 basic states</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
      The port is configured for fax, disabled for all data communications.</li>
            <li>
      The port is configured for incoming data calls, disabled for fax and outgoing data calls.</li>
            <li>
      The port is configured for outgoing data calls, disabled for fax and incoming data calls.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The current state is displayed, and the operator is prompted for the new state.&#160; If the new state would abort a job due to an incoming data call, the operator is warned and must confirm before aborting the dial-in task.</p>
        <p>In addition, this program provides the capability to restart the fax server. The fax server is the task that runs in the background to schedule fax transmissions. In most cases it will run without any operator intervention.&#160; However, sometimes when a fax port cannot be properly configured, restarting the fax server may resolve the problem.</p>
        <p>This program currently only supports one fax modem per system. If your system has more than one fax modem, the first one reported by the fxstat 
	command will be used by this program.</p>
