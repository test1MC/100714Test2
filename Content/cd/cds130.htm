        <p class="SectionDesc">This program can be used to perform a variety of different functions  on existing files or create (define) new ones.&#160;However, it is limited to accessing files within the Dynamo installation directory, which is typically U/CDI. 
	Since this program can erase or initialize data files, access should be 
	restricted.</p>
        <p><b>Entering File Name</b>
        </p>
        <p>In addition to entering a file name, on systems such as Linux that include the 'locate' 
	function, you can type "L" (capitalized followed by a space), and then the file 
	name to quickly display all occurrences of the file on the disc. You can then 
	select the desired file from the list to perform a variety of operations on that file.&#160;On UNIX systems, you can enter "F" (capitalized followed by a space) and the file 
	name to use the 'find' function that will search for various copies of the file. Searching for files by file type is also supported (e.g. "L .txt" will return a list of all TEXT files). Note that this option is based on the directory 
	database that is typically updated once each night.&#160;Therefore, this list will 
	exclude files created since the last database update.</p>
        <p>You can enter a folder name, or a folder name plus starting characters of 
	a file name, followed by <i>F2</i> to explore the files in the folder specified.&#160; 
	The operator can select the desired file by highlighting the desired file name 
	in an alphabetical list of files in the folder.&#160; Select the ".." file 
	to select the parent directory of your current directory .&#160; Select the "." file to select the 
	directory itself.</p>
        <p>When a job folder is active, <i>F5</i> will display files in the active job folder.</p>
        <p><b>Defining new files</b>
        </p>
        <p>If the file name entered does not exist, you can use the File Utility to create, or
	define, the file.&#160; If the file can be found in the data dictionary, then 
	it will be defined based on the data dictionary information, otherwise the 
	operator will be prompted to enter the file characteristics needed to define 
	the file.</p>
        <p>If you have job/project folders, with the format J/[Project#], then you 
	will have the option to define the new file or program in the active job 
	folder.&#160; The J menu option is used to activate a particular job.</p>
        <p><b>Options for Existing Files</b>
        </p>
        <p>The options available vary by file type and operating system.</p>

		very useful in that situation, although the key will be displayed in
