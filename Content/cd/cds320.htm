	applications.</p>
        <h5>Security Functions Overview</h5>
        <p>The security functions have been designed to prevent unauthorized use of a program, to log all system activity, and to report all invalid security overrides.</p>
        <p>Each operator or group of operators is assigned an operator ID code (up to 10 characters) and a password up to 8 characters. When first starting up a terminal, an operator ID and password is required. The operator has 3 attempts at entering his ID code and password. If unsuccessful after 3 attempts, access to the system will be denied.&#160; The operator may then hit the 'Enter' key and try to sign on again.&#160; If the software login (CDI login) is the same as the operating system login then the system overrides the 3 attempts.</p>
        <p>Operator Information Maintenance is used to specify which operators are supervisors. It also is used to give/deny an operator access to specific menus and programs. Operators can be given access to all, any, or no programs on each menu. Refer to the Operator Information Maintenance Help text for details.<br /><br />  &#160;</p>
