        <p class="SectionDesc">This program displays information about all Dynamo and 
	Dynaweb applications currently running.&#160; It can also be run using the T 
	option at any menu or Hotkey.&#160; Several different sequences, or views, are 
	available.&#160; This application can also be used to terminate (kill) a 
	hung or otherwise inaccessible application.&#160; Supervisor level security 
	is required to kill another process if not your own.&#160; If the Double 
	Vision remote control software is installed, then Display System Status can 
	also be used by authorized operators to view and manage another operators session. Note that users who did not exit their application properly may still show an active session running here and may still be occupying a software license.</p>

        <p>The D=Double Vision option is used to view and optionally operate the 
	selected session.&#160; This requires authorization and is typically used by 
	technical support personnel for training and problem resolution purposes.</p>
        <p>The K=Kill this process option should only be used when the job cannot be aborted from the terminal running the job.&#160; 
	This option requires the operator to have "Supervisor" security status as specified in 
	Operator Information Maintenance (SMS).&#160; In order to kill a BBj 
 process (Java-based version of Dynamo), you must first used the Basis Enterprise Manager to define an operator 
 named 'killBBj' with a password of 'killBBj123'.&#160; Check the permissions 
 box named 'BBj Processes'.</p>
