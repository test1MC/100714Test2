                    <p>This test sends a grid of lines to a PCL capable printer.&#160; The result should be that the grid is closed on all four edges of the page with approximately an equal blank margin on each edge.</p>

                    <p>Selecting "Yes" for this option also brings up another option for printing an <b>overlay file</b> over the grid. This is used if you have configured Dynamo to overlay an image, such as a company logo, on certain print types. In conjunction with the grid that is printed on the test page, you will be able to see where your image is located and make adjustments accordingly.</p>

This can be useful for serially connected printers which may be prone to data loss during data transmission relay. Most end-users will not need to run this test.</td>

                    <p>This test is used to determine what printer command  selects paper from the various paper trays that exist on laser printers and copiers. The printer tray selection command will be printed on the ouput page (see example below). 
Note that several pages will print, and some will print from the same tray (e.g if using a tray for standard printing as well as envelopes).  By using different colored paper, or handwriting some identifying text (such as "middle tray")on a few blank pages in each tray, you can determine which printer command pulls paper from which tray.
