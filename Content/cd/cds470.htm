                        <p>An alternate profile is actually an additional profile with the name .altsmsprofile which is run near the end of the standard profile. It can be used for selected operators or specialty devices such as a hand-held computer to run a menu system other than the standard Dynamo Tools menu. Note that this option is only used when there are selected users with special requirements. If all users require a special menu or initial program to run, then the /u/CDI/bin/profile.local file is used for those commands.</p>
