        <p class="SectionDesc">This application can be used by the operator currently logged in to set their name, phone numbers, and other operator profile information, as well as certain Dynamo preferences including font, font size, company code, and menu to use when Dynamo is started, etc.</p>
        <p class="SectionDesc">
It can also be used to create or update the desktop icons used to launch Dynastart.</p>
        <p class="SectionDesc">
For users that have an operating system login on a Linux/Unix system, this application can also be used to change the operator's operating system password. Note that Dynastart users do not typically need an operating system login. </p>

        <h5>Maintain Profile &amp; Preferences</h5>
        <p>This option is used for an operator to maintain the name, email address, and 
other profile information, as well as certain preferences including screen 
colors.&#160; It is also used to set or change the Dynamo Password which only 
applies when using Dynastart.&#160; Dynastart works on PCs and 
Apple Macs and Linux workstations.&#160; It does not use any terminal emulator 
such as FacetWin, PowerTerm, Terminal, etc.&#160; Typically Dynamo is launched 
using an icon on the desktop or Macs Application folder.</p>

Best practice is not to have any spaces in the Windows Login.&#160; If spaces 
are desired, then include quotes around the Login.&#160; It is possible to have 
multiple Windows Logins separated by a blank space as shown in the example 
above.</td>

        <h5>Create/Update Dynastart Shortcut</h5>
        <p>This option is used to either create or update the shortcut used to launch 
Dynamo using Dynastart.&#160;The Dynamo shortcut icon is typically located on the 
desktop. This option might be needed if the Dynastart shortcut was accidentally deleted.</p>
        <p>The Dynastart desktop icon will look similar to the image shown below.</p>

        <p>This option is used to Launch the Java Control Panel where Java-related settings can be modified. It is not typically needed, but can be used when there are problems launching Dynamo.</p>
        <p>The screen shots shown below are for Java version 1.8.0_25. For best results, update the version of Java on your workstation to this version or later. Oracle has made several changes to Java related to security.</p>
        <p>Specify the security level as High, and add the url you are using to install Dynamo in the Exception Site List as shown in the screen shot below.</p>

        <h5>Change Operating System Password</h5>
        <p>This option is used to set or change the operating system password on linux, 
AIX, and Unix servers.&#160; It is not required nor applicable when using Dynastart.&#160; Note that the default operating system password restrictions 
can be strict, including requirements that the password does not contain any 
words found in a dictionary.&#160; In most cases you can create a successful 
password that includes one or more upper case letters, one or more lower case 
letters, one or more numeric digits, and one or more special characters.&#160; 
Some operating systems require passwords to be at least 8 characters long.&#160; 
Example of a strong password: <code>7My$paSS</code>.</p>
        <p>Excellware can customize the password requirements based on your companies 
password policy.&#160; The possibilities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>eliminating the dictionary check</li>
            <li>requiring the password to be changed every so many days</li>
            <li>requiring the new password to be significantly different from the old</li>
            <li>requiring an upper case, lower case, number, and special character in 
	every password</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Contact Excellware support to customize the operating system password requirements.</p>
