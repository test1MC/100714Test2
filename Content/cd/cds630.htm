        <p>This program requires all other operators to be logged off and requires the 
	System Administrator (root) password.</p>
        <p>Prior to executing this application, download the software image file as 
	directed by Excellware or your software provider.&#160; Save this file in 
	the <code>$SMSDIR/tmp</code> folder on the server.</p>
        <p>The operator will be shown a list of the software packages to be updated 
	before the update takes place.</p>
        <h5>Technical Notes</h5>
        <p>The installation procedure involves calling a pre-installation routine, installing, (i.e., copying the files of the package into the desired directories), then calling a post-installation routine.&#160; In order to use the same media for both BBx Progression 3, 4, 
	and 5 target systems, the pre and post installation programs for P3 and P4+ are named differently.</p>
        <p>The installation routines are called programs with six character program names. The first three characters of the program are the same as the package. The last three characters of the program name can be determined using the table below.&#160; 
	The installation routines must be placed in the <code>$SMSDIR/pkg/</code> 
	directory prior to building the software package.</p>

        <p>The conversion routines may signal CDS630 to abort the installation.&#160; This may be required when the conversion routine cannot locate necessary files or determines there is insufficient disc space, etc.&#160; To signal CDS630 to abort the installation of this package and not to install any other packages on the media, exit with an error value of 99.&#160; This is accomplished using a statement
	<code>EXIT 99</code> as opposed to simply <code>EXIT</code>.</p>
        <p>In some cases, you may want to bypass the installation of a package but continue installing other packages on the media.&#160; This might be done when the media contains many packages, but the installation routine determines which packages are to be installed.&#160; In that case use an
	<code>EXIT 98</code>.&#160; The version record will not be written or replaced.</p>
