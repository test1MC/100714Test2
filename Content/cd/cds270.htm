        <p class="SectionDesc">The customer maintains his own security level codes 
	and company name and address.&#160; This program is used to save menu 
	security information when the menu file is being replaced with a copy from 
	Excellware.</p>
        <p>New programs are added to the selector and the selector file is copied to the customer's system.&#160; This destroys any program security level codes that the customer may have entered.&#160; In order to prevent this situation from occurring, this program will save these security level codes prior to replacing file XXS150 with a copy from 
	Excellware.&#160; Then after the file has been replaced, it will restore the saved security level codes.</p>
        <p>Only level codes above 1 are saved.&#160; Even if the program has been moved from one menu to another, the level code can be properly restored.&#160; Each program is identified by all 6 characters of the program name, plus the screen suffix and the pass parameter.&#160; Therefore, if the new selector file has a different pass parameter, for example, the level code will not be properly restored.&#160; In most cases the selector file has been changed due to new additions and not changes to existing entries on the menu.</p>
        <p>In addition to saving the security levels, this program saves the program memory pages, and the hot key selection code.</p>
        <p>The saved information is kept in file XXSD00 with a key of SECLV1XXX and removed after the restore has been completed.</p>
