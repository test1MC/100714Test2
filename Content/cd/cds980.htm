        <p class="SectionDesc">Several components of the Dynamo software are based on 
	operator licenses.&#160; This program is used to display operator Count Statistics 
	to determine if the number of licensed operators is sufficient to meet the needs 
	of your organization.</p>
        <p>O/S operators are Operating System operators.&#160; Some of the older operating 
	systems such as SCO Unix, and AIX were licensed based on the number of 
	simultaneous operators.&#160; Since 2000, Excellware has been using the Linux 
	operating system which does not have any operator license restrictions or fees 
	that are based on the number of operators.</p>
        <p>BBx operators are Business Basic operators.&#160; Dynamo is written in the BBx 
	programming language, and BBx is licensed based on the maximum number of 
	simultaneous operators.&#160; A BBx license is needed for each of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>each operator logged in,</li>
            <li>one for Dynamo System Administration which is always being used,</li>
            <li>one for certain other periodic processing including updating the Fax 
		Log,</li>
            <li>one for each PC that runs the UPS WorldShip, Federal Express 
		Shipment Manager, or other PC based shipment processing application that 
		uses ODBC to connect to Dynamo Data,</li>
            <li>one if an operator uses Microsoft Excel or other application to access 
		Dynamo data using ODBC,</li>
            <li>one for each additional operator session, except when using the FacetWin 
		terminal emulator, which only consumes on BBx license, regardless of the 
		number of Dynamo sessions opened on a single PC,</li>
            <li>one license is required each time a Dynaweb operator clicks the mouse.&#160; 
		This license is typically checked out and back in very quickly, except 
		when Dynaweb is creating a length report or scanning a large number of 
		data records.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that a hotkey does not require an additional BBx operator license.&#160; 
	BBx operator licenses typically have a one time cost between $100 and $175 
	depending on the number of operators currently licensed.</p>
        <p>SMS operators are Dynamo System Management operators.&#160; One Dynamo operator 
	license is required for each logged in operator.&#160; The one time cost for a 
	Dynamo operator license is $100 for the System Management Software, plus $400 
	for the Dynamo application.&#160; The Excellware Priority Support Plan fees 
	are based on the number of Dynamo operators.</p>
        <p>You can use the I for Information option at any menu to display the 
	number of operator licenses currently in use.&#160; Contact Excellware for more 
	information or to purchase additional operator licenses.</p>
