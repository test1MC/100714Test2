        <p>For the date indexes of 1 or higher, there are three methods of changing the date:</p><table><tr><td>1</td><td>You may add an entry to the selector to run the program CDC900.

        These two fields are used to prevent two or more operators from executing conflicting programs at the same time. They are often used to prevent someone from executing the same program from two different terminals at the same time.

        <p>The Type field can be P for Process, or R for Restrict. Multiple P type jobs may be run at the same time, but an R type job may only be run if there are no other jobs running with the same multi-tasking position. The Position field may be any number from 1 to 99. Only jobs with the same Position field conflict with each other.</p><p><i><b>For example</b></i>, an update program that should not be run from two terminals at the same time is coded R-10. The data entry program would be coded P-10. This will allow multiple data entry programs to execute at the same time, but prohibit the update if there is any other P-10 (or R-10) jobs running.</p><h6>Note that multi-tasking restrictions are company specific. There is no global system-wide multi-tasking.</h6></td>

This option is used mostly for printing listings or reports where no operator intervention is necessary to complete the job successfully once the printer has been selected and initial questions answered. It is not recommended for updates since unexpected errors may be encountered. This option is available only on selected MAI Basic Four computers.</td>

W is used for wide reports requiring up to 132 print positions. E is used for extra-wide reports requiring up to 255 print positions. Blank is the same as W.

        The menu processor will open data files and a printer if specified in the file name fields. If the first two characters of the file name is XX then the XX will be replaced with the company code.

        <p>The menu processor will open each data file to the channel indicated but will also set a numeric variable to the channel number as well. This numeric variable is the last four characters of the file name. For example if the first file to open is XXSO40 then a numeric variable named SO40 will be set to 1.&#160; It is the desired practice within the application to use SO40 as the channel number instead of 1.</p><p>The Block option applies only to certain MAI Basic Four systems that permit opening data files with a BLK=1024 option which improved sequential file performance.</p><p>The Lock option will lock the file if required.</p><p>If any data file has a string template associated with it, then a string variable will be dimensioned to this template with a name of the last four characters of the file name. For example S040$ will be dimensioned to the template for file XXS040.</p></td>
