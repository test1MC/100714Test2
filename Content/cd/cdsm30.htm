        <p class="SectionDesc">The Printer Control Maintenance is used to configure each printer to be used by Dynamo.&#160; 
	It is used to add, change, and delete printer information.&#160; For servers 
	running the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS)—such as Linux servers—
	Printer Control Maintenance also adds, changes, and deletes the printer 
	queues.</p>
        <p>For servers that do not use cups, or printer queues used by other Linux applications such as the Firefox web browser, web-based email, and 
	openoffice.org applications, the operating system print queues should be 
	defined using the printer configuration application included with the 
	operating system.</p>

Once archived, reports can be retrieved or deleted using the Dynastore Reports option on the SMS menu. DocStar is a 3rd party provider of, among other services, online document archiving.</p>
