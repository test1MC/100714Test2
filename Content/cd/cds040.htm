        <p class="SectionDesc">Adjust field lengths is used to set the fields in the records of a specific file to the proper sizes as defined in the Variable and File Data Dictionaries. It is usually required to run this program when a variable in a file is extended. This program should be run with caution, however, since unnecessary or incorrect use of it may result in corrupting existing data by shortening lengths of variables, etc.&#160; 
	This program is only required for use with non-template based files.&#160; 
	Files with a template should be modified using the File Utility (SMU).</p>
        <p>The operator enters the file name to be processed followed by the VDT 
	suffix. The file name is entered without the company code prefix, for 
	example, 'UM10', to process the customer file. The file description is 
	displayed to clearly identify the file for the operator. The operator must 
	verify whether the entered data is correct with a 'Y' or 'N' response. If 
	accepted, the adjustment begins.&#160;</p>
