        Changing an operator preference will not take effect until the next time the operator has logged in.
 Some terminals do not permit control of each preference option from the host computer. In this case, you may be able to set the preference item within the physical terminal setup. Refer to the terminal manual for setup details, or ask you System Administrator for assistance.&#160; Operators that are supervisors, may set preferences for all operators plus the default operator id of all *s. Non-supervisors are restricted to set preferences only for themselves.</p><p><img border="0" src="cdsd02-1.jpg" width="568" height="329" alt="" /></p><h6>The Operator Preference Maintenance Screen.</h6><p>1&#160; <a href="#Operator%20Preference">Operator Preference ID</a><br />  2&#160; <a href="#Terminal%20Function">Terminal function key group code</a><br />  3&#160; <a href="#Display%20Terminal%20Status">Display terminal status line&#160; (Y/N)</a><br />  4&#160; <a href="#Display%20Time">Display time on terminal status line</a><br />  5&#160; <a href="#Caps%20lock">Caps lock preference&#160; (0=off, 1=on)</a><br />  6&#160; <a href="#Scroll%20Rate">Scroll rate&#160; (j=jump, s=smooth)</a><br />  7&#160; <a href="#Display%20variables">Display variables in lower case</a><br />  8&#160; <a href="#Display%20keywords">Display keywords in lower case</a><br />  9&#160; <a href="#Keyclick">Keyclick&#160; (Y/N)</a><br />  10 <a href="#Key%20Repeat">Key repeat&#160; (Y/N)</a><br />  11 <a href="#Screen%20Saver">Screen Saver&#160; (Y/N)</a><br />  12 <a href="#Reverse%20Screen">Reverse screen display&#160; (Y/N)</a><br />  13 <a href="#Display%20Fortune">Display fortune message at login&#160; (Y/N)</a><br />  14 <a href="#Company%20Code%20at%20login">Company Code at Login</a><br />  15 <a href="#Menu%20Code">Menu Code at Login</a><br />  16 <a href="#Color%20Preference">Color preference</a></p><table><tr><th width="100%" colspan="2">Operator Preference</th></tr><tr><td><a name="Operator Preference"></a>Operator Preference ID</td><td>&#160;</td></tr><tr><td><a name="Terminal Function"></a>Terminal Function Key Group Code</td><td>This code refers to a Terminal Function Key Group that has been previously created using the Terminal Function Key Group Maintenance on the SMS menu. The default is STD. Should an operator desire different settings for their function keys, then make an entry here.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="Display Terminal Status"></a>Display Terminal Status Line</td><td>Some terminals have a status line at the top of the screen which may include indicators if the CAPS or NUM lock keys are on, whether the terminal is in full duplex or block mode, etc. Answer Y to keep this line displayed. Answer N to leave the status line off. The default is Y to display the status line.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="Display Time"></a>Display Time on Terminal Status Line</td><td>Some terminals include a clock within the logic of the terminal. If your terminal has this feature, and you have the status line turned on, the CDI System Management Software set the clock on your terminal when you log log on to match the clock in the computer. The terminal will then always display the current time on the status line.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="Caps lock"></a>Caps lock Preference</td><td><table><tr><td width="50%">0</td><td width="50%">off</td></tr><tr><td width="50%">1</td><td width="50%">on</td></tr></table><p>Some terminals such as the Wyse 60 and 160 permit the host system to turn on/off the CAPS lock. Since Unix systems prefer a lower case login, you generally want the terminal setup to be saved while the CAPS lock is off. That way when you turn on the terminal, you can login in lower case, and if you prefer all upper case entries, then set this option to 1, so CDI SMS will turn on the CAPS lock if this option is available for your terminal.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a name="Scroll Rate"></a>Scroll Rate</td><td><table><tr><td width="50%">j</td><td width="50%">jump</td></tr><tr><td width="50%">s</td><td width="50%">smooth</td></tr></table><p>The scroll rate of a terminal refers to how quickly a line is deleted from the display, and how quickly the lines below move up. The J option causes a quick, and the S option causes a slower scroll. The default is J for Jump.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a name="Display variables"></a>Display variables in lower case</td><td>This operator preference permits programmers to have the program code display variable names in lower case if desired. Some find it easier to locate variables when they are different from the other parts of the program.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="Display keywords"></a>Display keywords in lower case</td><td>This is similar to the option above, except for keywords in a program such as LET, PRINT, RUN, etc.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="Keyclick"></a>Keyclick</td><td>Keyclick is an audible sound that some terminals can make each time a key is pressed. The options are Y or N. The default is N.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="Key Repeat"></a>Key Repeat</td><td>Most terminals will repeat a key if held down for a longer period of time. This is very useful when using the arrow keys to move around, since you can hold down the key and watch, then let up when you are at the desired location. The options are Y and N. The default is Y.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="Screen Saver"></a>Screen Saver</td><td>Some terminals have built in option to blank the terminal screen if there is no activity for a period of time, usually 5 minutes or so.&#160; It is said that the terminal display will last longer and reduce the etching effect that can occur on the face of the terminal. Touching any key will cause the screen to re-display. The best key to touch is the Shift key, since it does not do anything unless another key is touched. Unfortunately, some terminals do not redisplay when you only touch the Shift key. The options are Y and N. The default is Y.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="Reverse Screen"></a>Reverse Screen Display</td><td>Some terminals can display dark letters on a light colored background.&#160; This is the reverse of most terminals that display lighted letters on a dark screen background. Some proponents of this reverse screen display argue that the terminal looks more like a printed page, i.e., dark letters on a light background. The options are Y for reverse display (dark on light) or N for normal (light on dark). The default is N.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="Display Fortune"></a>Display Fortune Message at login</td><td>When set to Y, this preference will display a message to ponder at login time. The message is selected at random from a long list. Some of the messages are significant only to computer programmers, but many are entertaining or thought provoking for all. This option functions only on Unix systems and requires /usr/games/fortune to be executable.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="Company Code at login"></a>Company Code at login</td><td>If present, this is the company code that will be selected upon login. If not specified, the company code will be the same company code when this terminal was last used.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="Menu Code"></a>Menu Code at login</td><td><p>This optional entry will be the menu presented upon login. If not specified, then the SYS menu will be presented if menu code SYS exists, and the operator has sufficient security. Otherwise, the first menu code encountered that has sufficient security will be presented.</p><p>The above two options are especially useful for network connected devices such as personal computers, net terminals, and net stations. This is because the terminal ID of these devices vary each time they log in.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a name="Color Preference"></a>Color Preference</td><td><p>This is only available on color terminal and monitors. Selection of this option permits the operator to specify a particular color combination for the main display, the F1 (hotkey) window, the F2 (options) window, and the F3 (help) window. By specifying different colors, for different companies, you can more easily identify which company is active on systems with multiple companies.</p><p>Note that when you touch the F2 key for the company code within the color preferences, an asterisk (*) will display next to the company code if you have a preference set up for that particular company. You may also specify company code ** which indicates all companies that have not been assigned their own color preference.</p><p>Two other options are available on older systems that permit the operator to define the cursor shape (line or block), and steady or blink. These options are no longer available, since there are now a part of the terminal definition (termcap) file. The standard cursor shape is steady block under normal terminal functions, and a blinking block when using insert mode.</p></td></tr></table><p><br />  &#160;</p></body>
