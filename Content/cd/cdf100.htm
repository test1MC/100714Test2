        <p class="SectionDesc">This application can be used to transfer data dictionary information from one company to another.&#160; It has been replaced by the Data Dictionary Export/Import on the FMS menu.&#160; However, it is still used to copy an entire menu from one company to another.</p>

        <p>In addition to copying a menu from one company to another, you can also copy a menu from/to the same company if the 'copy from' company menu file is located in a folder named XXOLD/ where XX is the company code.&#160; The menu file name is XXSI50, so if files RL/RLSI50 and RLOLD/RLSI50 both exist, then this application can be used to copy menus from RLOLD/RLSI50 to RL/RLSI50.&#160; In the XXOLD/SSXI50 menu file exists, the operator will be prompted: Use XXOLD/ files (Y/N).</p>
