As an example, if the system code being printed is SOP Sales Order Processing and this flag is 'Y', then all of the information which has printed for SOP (screen formats, text, etc.) will print for SOU Sales Order Processing Utility Functions, a subselector of the main selector, SOP.

        <p>The setting of these flags depends on the purpose of printing the text. If the purpose is to fulfill a specific need of the operator, then most of the flags should be set to 'N'. As an example, if the operator needed to know which programs interfaced through the selector are missing text and/or a VDT, then all other flags should be set to 'N' to avoid printing unnecessary information and wasting paper. If the purpose is to provide a documentation manual for a new customer, then the flags should be set to the defaults as described above in order to keep the information about their system as concise and un-technical as possible.<br /><br />  &#160;</p>
