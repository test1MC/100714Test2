        <p class="SectionDesc">This program is used to display and change printer status 
	information.&#160; It is available on 
	servers that use the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) including servers 
	running RedHat Linux.</p>
        <p>The initial display shows the version of the cups software installed, the 
	status of the print scheduler that runs in the background, and provides a 
	list of options.</p>

        <p><b>Queue</b>: The Queue (pronounced like the letter Q), is the cups 
	printer destination.&#160; Dynamo sends print jobs to the cups print 
	scheduler, who then sends the print jobs to the printer, as each printer 
	becomes available.&#160; When the print scheduler cannot send a print job to 
	a printer, an error message such as the one shown in the example above might 
	be displayed.</p>
        <p><b>Connection</b>: This describes how the printer is physically attached 
	and how the server communicates with the printer.&#160; Some options 
	include:</p>

                <td>Also known as HP Jet Direct printing, this printing method 
			communicates with the printer using a TCP socket, typically using 
			port 9100.&#160; The printer is attached to an ethernet switch using 
			an 8-wire ethernet patch cable that looks like a large telephone 
			connector.&#160; The ethernet cable may be either connected directly 
			to the printer (for those printers equipped with an ethernet port), 
			or to what is called an external print server.&#160; An external 
			print server is a small device that has one ethernet jack which 
			connects to the network switch, and one or more ports that are 
			connected to the printers.&#160; These ports are typically parallel, 
			but can also be USB or serial.</td>

        <p><b>Accepting</b>: A print queue normally will accept new print jobs.&#160; 
	You can change the printer to 'Reject' new print job requests if the printer 
	is in for repair, and you do not want anyone to send print jobs to the 
	printer.</p>
        <p><b>Enabed</b>: A print queue is normally enabled.&#160; You can disable 
	the print queue to prevent the print scheduler from sending any more jobs to 
	the printer.&#160; When a printer is disabled, it will still accept print 
	jobs from applications, but will not send the print job to the printer until 
	it is enabled.&#160; A printer might be disabled for a brief time when the 
	ribbon or toner is being changed, or for other short term maintenance.</p>
        <p><b>Jobs Waiting</b>: The number of print jobs waiting to be printed is 
	shown.</p>
        <p><b>Status Lines</b>: Printer status information from the scheduler 
	displays here.&#160; When a printer is not printing, this status information 
	might help to resolve the problem.&#160; In the example shown, the server is 
	unable to locate the PC that the printer is attached to.&#160; The PC could 
	be powered off or disconnected from the network, or the PC might have been 
	configured to require an operator name and password to print.&#160; Powering off, 
	waiting 15 seconds, and powering back on the printer, and/or external print 
	server, or rebooting the PC can sometimes resolve this problem if the 
	printer was printing previously with the same configuration.&#160; Most 
	external print servers do not have an on/off switch, so they must be 
	unplugged in order to power cycle them.&#160; This is sometimes required 
	after a power failure.</p>
        <p>The following options may be available depending on how the printer is 
	connected and if any print jobs are waiting.</p>
        <p><b>Show/Cancel/Move Print Jobs</b>:&#160; Select this option to display 
	the list of print jobs pending for the printer.&#160; Highlight and select a 
	print job to cancel it or to move it to another printer.&#160; Note that 
	the Move option does not function in all versions of cups even though 
	Dynamo provides the option to do so.&#160; The following screen shows a 
	typical listing.</p>
        <p>
            <img border="0" src="cds2205.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p><b>Cancel All Print Jobs</b>: Select this option to cancel all print jobs 
	scheduled for the selected printer.&#160; It has no effect on other 
	printers.</p>
        <p><b>Ping Test</b>: The communication link with printers connected using 
	socket, lpd, and smb using an IP address, can be tested using this option.&#160; 
	The server will send a packet out to the printer, which will respond if the 
	communication link is operational.&#160; If communication cannot be 
	established with the printer, then the printer and/or external print server, 
	may be powered off, or not connected to the network, or the IP address of 
	the printer or external print server might differ with that in the server's 
	configuration for the printer.&#160; When using smb printing, this option is 
	only available when the PC is using a fixed (static) IP address.</p>
        <p><b>Enable or Disable</b>: A print queue must be enabled to send print 
	jobs to the printer.&#160; If the display indicates the printer is Disabled, 
	try using the Enable option.&#160; If the printer returns to the disabled 
	state, then the print scheduler is unable to communicate with the printer, 
	external print server, PC, network terminal, etc.</p>
        <p><b>Accept or Reject</b>: The scheduler will refuse to accept new print 
	jobs if this status is Reject.&#160; You would typically configure the print 
	queue to Reject requests when the printer is being repaired or otherwise 
	unavailable.</p>
        <p><b>Display Printer or Cancelled Jobs</b>: This option will display the 
	most recent jobs sent to the printer that were either printed or cancelled.&#160; 
	This list is purged automatically and may not include any print jobs 
	depending on when the printer was last used.</p>
