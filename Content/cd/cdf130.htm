        Dynamo typically uses a 6 character file name that starts with the two character company code.&#160; The data dictionary should only include that portion of the file name that follows the company code.&#160; In this example, the file name is DSCM01, the company code is DS, so only CM01 is needed here.&#160; You may store files with names up to 
		10 characters long (excluding the 2 character company code).<br /><br />       Data Dictionary Maintenance can also be used for describing other data structures that are used to store data and transfer between programs.&#160; The File Name field would often refer to the string variable name used (excluding the trailing 
		dollar sign).&#160; For example, program CM040 has a data structure used to pass information to and back from CM040.&#160; The File Name field in that example would be CM040.&#160; The company used to store the Data Dictionary for program templates should be the same as the folder where the program is located.&#160; In this example, the CM040 program is located in the DY/ directory, so company DY should be used to store the Data Dictionary.

        <p>&#160;</p><p>Temporary work files should also be described in the Data Dictionary.&#160; Temporary files are designated using a period following the file name.&#160; The CM040 program, for example, creates a work file.&#160; This work file has a data dictionary file name of CM040. (including the period at the end).&#160; 
		No other periods may appear in the File Name.</p></td>

        This is the bbx compatible template field name.&#160; It can be up to 16 characters containing letters, numbers, and underscore, and must begin with a letter.

        <p><br />        Field names in the format FSn where n is a number have special significance in Dynamo Tools.&#160; They indicate that the field represents a field separator, used in files that still use an IOLIST for reading and writing data.&#160; In the example above FS1 is the first field separator in the record.&#160; Note that the NAME field is variable length and does not have an FS2 field following it.&#160; This is because the NAME field truly is variable in length, where the CUSTNO field is always 6 characters long, and thus requires a template type of C(6) and not C(6*).</p><p>It is our recommendation, that any new file use fixed length fields, and no field separators.&#160; The CVS() function can be used to strip trailing blanks from fields when required.</p></td>

                <td>
        This is the bbx template type.&#160; A character type is assumed, so an entry of 10 will display as C(10).&#160; An entry of 10* will display as C(10*).&#160; An entry of N5 will display as N(5).&#160; The * indicates variable length, but unlike bbx, Dynamo assumes the number before the * is the maximum length of the field.

        <p><br />       For new files, we recommend using fixed length field types.&#160; The CVS() function can be used to strip trailing blanks from fields when required.&#160; We also recommend using B type fields for all numeric fields that have fractional places such as any field containing amounts of dollars and cents.</p><p>We also suggest using U(3) fields for all dates, and storing the date in the julian format.&#160; The DATE() function can be used when required to format this internal date value.&#160; However, the Dynamo Data Dictionary will support dates in C(8) format: MM/DD/YY, C(6)/N(6) format: YYMMDD, N(5) format using the Microsoft serial# date, or C(8)/N(8) format: YYYYMMDD.</p><p>Note that unlike bbx that uses -1 as the julian date value for a field without a date, and 0 to indicate today's date, Dynamo considers a date with a value of 0 as a field without a date.&#160; This definition eliminates the need to populate newly dimensioned string templates containing date fields with -1 values.</p></td>
