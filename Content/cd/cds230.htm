        <p class="SectionDesc">The purpose of this program is to permit easy assignment of function and editing key values on selected terminals.&#160; Certain terminals have function keys labeled F1, F2, F3, or PF1, PF2, PF3, etc.&#160; These keys can be set up so that touching a single function key, the terminal sends to the computer one or more characters.</p>
        <p>For example, you may set the F6 key to send 'SMS followed by ENTER, and 2 followed by ENTER.'&#160; Then from any menu, when you touch the F6 key, the terminal will send the SMS 'Enter' and 2 'Enter' to the computer, which will run program 2 on the SMS menu.&#160; If this is a program that you run frequently, it is easier to touch the F6 key than to type in the complete sequence of keys.</p>
        <p>Each function key can store two sets of sequences, one when the function key is touched alone, and one when it is touched while holding down the shift key.&#160; Some terminals such as the Wyse 30 have only 4 function keys, while others have 12, 14, or even 16.</p>
        <p>
            <img border="0" src="cds2301.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>In addition to function keys, many terminals also have editing keys.&#160; Editing keys include the four directional arrows, keys such as insert, delete, home, end, page up, page down, print screen, tab, escape, backspace, enter/return, and enter on the keypad.</p>
        <p>This program is used to specify what characters each function and editing key will generate.&#160; There are three groups of keys that are pre-defined named EDIT, OSP 
	and STD.&#160; These keys will be set when an operator signs on to the 
	system unless a different group code is assigned to the operator in the 
	Operator Preference Maintenance program.&#160; Do not modify or delete these 
	pre-defined groups as they will be replaced during a Dynamo Tools upgrade.&#160; You may create new groups and even copy existing groups and modify them.&#160; Then use Operator Preference Maintenance to indicate which function key group a given operator should use.</p>
        <h5>Entering key values</h5>
        <p>For all text and most special keys, just touch the key desired.&#160; 
	Since the Enter key and all other function keys are valid, the Delete key is 
	used to complete the entry.&#160; If your keyboard does not have a Delete 
	key (like an Apple Mac), then wait 10 seconds, or try touching Ctrl+F1 or 
	Ctrl+@ which will also terminate the entry on many workstations and 
	emulators.</p>
        <p>For Function Keys F1 through F4, enter the key sequence shown in the 
	table below.</p>
