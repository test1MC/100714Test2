        <p class="SectionDesc">This option is used to purge the log of outbound and 
	inbound faxes, as well as internet email sent using Dynamo.</p>
        <p>The log of all faxes older than the number of days entered by the operator will be purged from the <a href="cds360.htm">Fax Log and Options</a> 
	screen.&#160; For example, if the operator enters 365 on this screen, all 
	faxes older than 1 year will be purged from the log.&#160; The default value 
	is 90 days.&#160; Archived copies of faxes are also purged during this 
	process.&#160; The fax scheduler is temporarily shut down during this 
	process in order to compress certain fax database files.</p>
        <h6>Note: Because of the amount of disk space this log can take up, it is recommended that the log be purged on a regular basis.</h6>
