        <p class="SectionDesc">The purpose of the system activity log is to give an account of who, when, and how long each program has been run since the last time the report was printed.&#160; 
	The System Activity Log is enabled using System Control Maintenance (SMC).&#160; 
	If you enable the System Activity Log, be sure to print and clear the data 
	periodically, as it can consume quite a bit of disc space.</p>
        <p>If this program is to be printed by an operator who does not have supervisor status, then a supervisor will be required to enter their operator ID and password after this report is selected from the menu.</p>

        <h6>The System Activity Log Screen</h6>
        <p>The operator has the option to print the report or to simply clear all system activity. The data should be cleared only if you do not require any of the reports. Once cleared, the report cannot be printed.</p>

        <p>Following any summary options selected, the total time used by terminal ID, operator ID, and company code is printed. This information should be useful in determining where workload is lightest and heaviest to aid in relocating or obtaining additional terminals.</p>
        <p>If any of the two detail options were selected, the normal wide paper is required. The summary pages require only the narrow 8.5 inch wide paper.</p>
