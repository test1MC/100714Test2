        <p class="SectionDesc">Dynamo separates files by company or organization using a two character 
 upper case company code.&#160; This company code becomes the first two characters of all data 
 dictionary files, and typically all data files.&#160; Each company has its 
 own folder immediately below the Dynamo Tools install folder with a folder 
 name equal to the company code.&#160; <code>/u/CDI/CD</code>, <code>/u/CDI/DS</code>, 
 and <code>/u/CDI/DY</code> are examples of company folders.&#160; This application is used to define a new Dynamo company, 
 to archive an existing company, or to change the 2 character company code.</p>

 define company files in an alternate directory that you enter.&#160; Note 
 that you will need to use the <code>P</code> menu option to set the prefix 
 to access a company not located in the default directory of <code>XX/</code>.&#160; 
 If the new Company Directory does not exist, and you do not have 
 permissions to define the new directory, then <code>sudo</code> will be 
 used on Linux/Unix systems.&#160; The <code>sudo</code> commands needed 
 are <code>mkdir</code>, <code>chown</code>, and <code>chmod</code>.</td>

 You can still access an archived company by including the company 
 directory in your prefix list.&#160; The most popular way this is done is 
 using the P option in any Dynamo Tools menu.</td>
