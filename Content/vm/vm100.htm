        <p class="SectionDesc">The Vendor Inquiry program is used to access vendor information quickly and easily. You can retrieve invoice detail including general ledger distribution, find out when you last paid a vendor, see how much business you've done with this vendor on a monthly or yearly basis, and look up vendor addresses and phone numbers.&#160;The Notepad feature allows you to enter free-form notes. &#160;Any of this information can be viewed on the screen or printed.</p>
        <p>Vendor Inquiry is accessed from the VML menu, but is also available on the 
	INQ menu.</p>
        <p>Select the vendor by entering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vendor Number</li>
            <li>A few characters of the Alpha Sort Name</li>
            <li>First or Last Name of a Vendor Contact</li>
            <li>Email address of a Vendor Contact</li>
            <li>Vendor's Phone Number</li>
            <li>Vendor's Zip Code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If more than one vendor meets the selection criteria entered, then the operator 
	will be able to select the vendor from the list.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Once a vendor has been selected, the vendor#, name, address, and 2 phone numbers 
	are displayed as well as a list of options.&#160; Each of these options is marked with an asterisk '*', the letter 'A', 'D', 'S', or a blank:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An asterisk '*' indicates there is data available to display for this option.</li>
            <li>The letter 'A' indicates that no data is available, but you may select this option and enter information.</li>
            <li>The letter 'D' indicates this option is disabled.</li>
            <li>The letter 'S' indicates you do not have sufficient security clearance for this option.</li>
            <li>A blank next to an option indicates there is no data to display.</li>
