        <p>Item Files Cleanup is used to fix files in Dynamo that could have become corrupt. The application checks inside any file that contains an item number, such as in keyword files, number files, notepads, equivalent item files, vendor number files, item label and location files, and sales information files. It will discover if an item is associated with a file, and if not, it will delete that file. The operator simply types Y&#160;or N to proceed with the application. Dynamo displays the files it corrected, shows if any were deleted, and displays the status of each one.</p>
