        <p>Item Deletion is used to delete a range of items. The item(s) must not have current inventory, must not be on order, and must not have had recent activity in order to be deleted. Most operators do not like to delete items because it also deletes the item history. Once an item is deleted, it cannot be brought back, and therefore its history cannot be searched within Dynamo anymore. However, if your company has started selling a different brand of products and will never sell the other brand again,  deleting the item(s)&#160;may be beneficial. </p>
        <p>After being run, the application displays what has been deleted, and it explains why certain items cannot be deleted (such as current inventory, on order, recent activity, etc). </p>
