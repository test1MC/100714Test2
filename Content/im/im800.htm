        <p class="SectionDesc">Use Assortment&#160;Maintenance to create new assortments and modify existing ones. Reasons for creating assortments include simplifying the sale of items that are frequently purchased together as well as providing a method for altering prices when items are purchased as a group.</p>
        <p>Assortments are a group of products or services sold as a single parent item number and are often referred to as "bundles" or "kits." The operator first creates a new item in <a href="../xx/xxim01.htm">Item Maintenance</a> to act as the assortment item# (parent) and then uses Assortment Maintenance to indicate all of the components that will belong to the assortment (dependent). </p>
