        <p>Excellware uses Transfer Order File Integrity Tests to find and correct any errors within an operator's transfer order files. If immediate repair cannot be made, the test reports and prints out errors that can be corrected later. These errors may relate to out-of-balance items, non-applicable characters appearing in certain fields, or incorrectly processed transactions. Typically, these tests are used after a customer's files have been converted during an upgrade or after a program revision. The operator does not need to run this application. </p>
