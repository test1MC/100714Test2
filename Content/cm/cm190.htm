        <p style="font-style: normal;">This application allows the batch correction of customer addresses within Dynamo. The application verifies the addresses by comparing them to the post office listing. It can fix the spelling of street names, normalize the addresses (abbreviates <i>street</i>, <i>road</i>, <i>drive</i>, etc.), and verify the Zip+4 code. Customer Address Correction can also notify you if  a number in the address does not exist on that particular street, but at that point you must manually correct the number. </p>
        <p style="font-style: normal;">After the application has automatically corrected any errors, it will prompt you to correct them manually if necessary. The customer addresses from this program print so you can view any errors within your addresses. Once you have viewed the list, you can manually update any addresses in Dynamo. </p>
