        <p class="SectionDesc">Customer Inquiry is used to display related information on file for a particular customer.</p>
        <p>The operator will be asked to enter a customer by customer number, alpha sort name, phone number, or zip code. Once the customer has been entered, the screen will display the customer number, name and address, the primary contact, and the telephone number.</p>
        <p>If an <b>*</b> is entered, the operator will be able to view customers to contact based on the Call Back Date stored in Customer Maintenance. The call backs that display are from today to 3 days into the future. If the operator wishes to change the salesman to view call backs for, enter an <b>*</b> at the prompt for selecting the customer# to call back.</p>
        <p>At this point, a window will display with all of the options that are available through Customer Inquiry.</p>
