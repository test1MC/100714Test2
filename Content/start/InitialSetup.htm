        <p class="SectionDesc">Dynamo has the powerful ability to link many business processes to each other so that your business runs as a whole. As a few examples, Dynamo links purchase orders to inventory, inventory to sales orders, sales orders to customers and payments, and all of this to the general ledger. On top of that, the Dynamo experience is customizable. As such, there is a need to prime Dynamo with as much information about your company as possible in order to make all business components work together. The following set of procedures is meant to do just that. </p>
        <p class="SectionDesc">If this is your first time using a character-based application, you may want to view Excellware's brief tutorials covering general navigation and data entry. These include <a href="DataEntry.htm">data entry conventions</a>, <a href="MenuOptions.htm">navigating menus</a>, <a href="DataEntryDates.htm">entering dates</a>, <a href="DataEntryLists.htm">selecting records from a list</a>, and <a href="DataEntryGrid.htm">selecting records from a grid</a>. </p>
        <p class="SectionDesc">Note that each step below should be followed in order. For more detailed help, there is a link in each step to the Dynamo documentation page for that program.</p>
