        <p class="SectionDesc">Java is not required for applications running pro5 nor vpro5, however, Java is required when running BBj.&#160; This document describes how to download, install, configure, and link a BBj installation to a particular Java version.</p>
        <p>Java is a programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, IBM, and others.&#160; It became an Oracle product when Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems. A compatible version of Java must be installed when using BBj.&#160; Java is available in a run-time only environment called a JRE (Java Runtime Environment), and a full developers environment called a JDK (Java Developers Kit).</p>
        <p>When installing Java on a server, always install the JDK and not just the JRE, as certain features of BBj, such as signing JAR&#160;files, require the JDK. Version 1.7.0_45 or later is recommended. For additional details, visit the Dynamo Tools <a href="http://www.excellware.com/docs/tools/tools.htm#Installation.htm?TocPath=_____3">Installation</a> page.</p>
        <p>If installing Java on a Microsoft Windows PC or Apple Mac for use with the BBj thin client, then the JRE can be installed.</p>

        <h5>Microsoft Windows</h5>
        <p>In some cases, multiple versions of Java must be installed to support applications other than BBj that are running on the same PC.&#160; Oracle supports multiple major versions of Java, such as 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7, installed on a PC at the same time.&#160; When multiple versions of Java are installed, the version used by web browsers is managed using the Java Runtime Environment Settings located on the Java tab of the Java Control Panel.&#160;(The Java Control Panel can be opened in both Windows 7 and 8.1 by searching for "configure Java" and clicking on the search result.) See screen shot below.</p>

        <p>You can confirm that Java is installed properly and which version is being used from any web browserusing this link: <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp">http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp</a></p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You can also use a Windows Command Prompt to confirm that Java is installed properly, and which version is used,  by entering: <code>java -version</code> as shown below:</p>
