        <p>Excellware strives to design software that enables the computer to help you do your job.&#160; We also want to prevent data entry errors whenever possible.&#160; This is especially true when entering dates.</p>
        <p>The following rules apply to all date entries:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You do not need to enter the / characters.&#160; You can if you really want to, but its usually easier just to enter the numbers.</li>
            <li>You do not need to enter the year.&#160; Dynamo will append a year depending on the month you entered, and the current month.&#160; Dynamo will choose the closest year.&#160; For example, in December, or even August, if you enter 0101, Dynamo will assume January 1 of next year.&#160; Similarly, in January or even June, if you enter 1231, Dynamo will assume December 31 of last year.&#160; Try leaving the year off when entering dates.&#160; Dynamo will guess correctly most of the time.</li>
            <li>You do not need to enter the month unless it is different from the current month.&#160; So you can simply enter 10 and in July 1995, the date displayed will be 07/10/95.</li>
            <li>The leading zero is not required for the month nor for the day.&#160; For example, you could enter 85 and in 1995, the date displayed will be 08/05/95.&#160; But in cases of ambiguity, such as 111 the program adds a leading zero to the month and assumes 01/11 not 11/01.</li>
            <li>The letter T can be used whenever you want today's date.&#160; Once you enter a T, you can still use option 6 below.</li>
            <li>Touch + or - to advance to the next or previous date.&#160; Note that the = character also acts like + so you don't have to hold the shift key down.</li>
            <li>Touch W or w to advance to the next or previous week.</li>
            <li>Touch C or c to bring up calendar for selecting date.</li>
            <li>Year 2000 issues: This program does not permit the operator to enter the complete 4 digit year.&#160; Rather, it assumes the century based on today's date.&#160; It allows date entries in the past 90 years, the current year, and the next 9 years. For example, if today is 2/14/99 and you enter a year of 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, or 08, then the year will be assumed to be 20xx.&#160; If you enter 09, 10, 11,...,99 then the year will assumed to be 19xx. If you need to enter a date that is earlier than 90 years ago, or more than 9 years from today, please contact your software supplier or Excellware, Inc.</li>
            <li>If you've made some entries and want to return to the original default date, simply touch the Escape key.&#160; Note that there is sometimes a brief pause after touching the Escape key before the original date is displayed.<br />
    &#160;</li>
