        <p class="SectionDesc">A Virtual Private Network can be used to enable remote 
	access to the Dynamo server or other servers and resources on your office 
	network.&#160; Even though you are using the public internet, all data 
	between your workstation and the office network is encrypted.&#160; The VPN 
	creates what is called a 'tunnel' where your secure information can flow.</p>
        <p class="SectionDesc">In many cases, you can use Dynamo from home, a hotel, or wherever there is an internet connection without requiring a Virtual Private Network (VPN).&#160; However, if you want to access shared files stored on the server or your office PC, or remotely control your office PC from home, then you need a VPN.&#160; A VPN does not require any special hardware at the remote location but does require VPN 
	software.</p>
        <p>There are several types of VPN's.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An IPSec VPN is typically used between your headquarters and your 
		branch offices or retail stores.&#160; These VPN's are established by 
		configuring the router at each end of the connection.&#160; This 
		document does not discuss IPSev VPN's.</li>
            <li>A Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol VPN (pptp) is typically used to 
		temporarily connect a single workstation to the office network.&#160; A 
		pptp VPN requires software on the workstation.&#160; Pptp VPN software is included with Windows XP and 
		newer, as well as on Apple Macintosh and tablet computers including the 
		iPad.&#160; The router at the office establishes the VPN.&#160; 
		MultiTech routers include the pptp server feature required.&#160; Most 
		Small Business Cisco routers do not include the pptp server feature.&#160; 
		However the Cisco RV220W router does.&#160; If you have a Small Business 
		Cisco router at the office that does not support the standard pptp VPN 
		software that comes with Windows and Mac OS-X, you can still establish a 
		VPN to your office network using one of the other options listed below.&#160; 
		This document illustrates how to define a pptp VPN connection.</li>
            <li>Some manufacturers including Cisco and SonicWall provide special 
		software to create a temporary VPN that go by names such as Quick-VPN 
		and NetExtender.&#160; These VPN's typically only are available for 
		Windows PC's and not Apple products.&#160; Refer to the manufacturers 
		operator guide for additional details.</li>
            <li>SSL VPN's are established using your browser.&#160; These VPN's can 
		be established on workstations and network devices such as tablets that 
		have a web browser and support Java.&#160; This document provides an 
		example of connecting using a SSL VPN where your office has a Cisco 
		Small Business router.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will need three things to connect using a VPN.&#160; Contact Excellware 
	for this information.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The connection url or IP address.&#160; This is a web address such as 
		mycompany.dyndns.org or vpn.mycompany.com or an IP address such as 
		99.123.1.55.</li>
            <li>A VPN Login ID.&#160; The VPN Login ID may be different than your 
		Dynamo Login ID.</li>
            <li>A VPN Password.&#160; The VPN Password may be different than your 
		Dynamo Login ID.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note that when using a VPN over the internet to connect to your office 
	network, the performance will not be as good as it is when you are at the 
	office.&#160; However, in most cases the speed is acceptable.&#160; But be 
	patient, especially when browsing shared folders on the server.</p>

        <p>Open a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or even Internet Explorer).&#160; 
	Enter the address such as
	<a href="https://mydnsname.dyndns.org/portal/SSLVPN">

        <p>Click on the icon with the three blue spheres and cloud to establish the 
	VPN connection.&#160; Any software required will be downloaded.&#160; You 
	may encounter a prompt such as this:</p>
        <p>
            <img border="0" src="vpn.ht15.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>You can click the 'Yes to All' button to download the latest version of 
	the VPN client software.</p>
        <p>On Window's PC's there will be a couple new icons that appear in the 
	status bar.&#160; You can right-click on the icon for VPN status, or to 
	disconnect the VPN.</p>
        <p>At this point you should be able to access Dynamo and shared folders on 
	the Dynamo server or other shared resources on your office network, much 
	like you can from the office.&#160; In some cases you must use the server IP 
	address instead of the name, because the name resolution for resources at 
	your office are not typically available across the VPN.&#160; Contact 
	Excellware for assistance.</p>
        <p>The VPN is closed when you close the browser tab.&#160; Be careful to 
	keep the browser tab open as long as you need the VPN connection.</p>
        <p>Note that you can change your VPN password by clicking on the Change 
	Password option located on the left side.&#160; You will need to enter your 
	old password once, and your new password twice.&#160; Best passwords include 
	one or more capital letters, small letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>
