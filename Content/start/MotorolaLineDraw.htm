        <p class="SectionDesc">Dynamo Tools use Line Drawing Characters for outlining windows and boxes.&#160; In many cases, the fonts that come pre-installed exclude these Line Drawing Characters.&#160; However, you can easily download and install a Courier New True Type Font that includes these characters, and install on the mobile computer.</p>
        <p>If the Line Drawing Characters on the Dynascan menu do not display properly, then it is likely that the installed font lack the Line Drawing Characters.</p>
        <p>Click <a href="../downloads/cour.ttf">here</a> to download the font file, and <a href="../downloads/cour.cpy">here</a> to download a batch file.&#160; Transfer these two files to the mobile device using the Active Sync program and place in the \Application folder.&#160; The presence of the batch (.cpy) file should cause the cour.ttf file to be copied to the \Windows folder.&#160; Select the Courier New font in the emulation parameters, and test the Dynascan menu to verify that the Line Drawing Characters display properly.</p>
