        <p class="SectionDesc">Dynamo includes a Google like ability to search for Customers.&#160;&#160; Just enter what you know, and Dynamo will provide a list of matching customers.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of what you can enter.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th nowrap="nowrap">You Enter</th>
                <th>Note</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td nowrap="nowrap">Dynamo Customer#</td>
                <td>You can always enter the Dynamo Customer#, if you know it.&#160; But when you don't know it, enter something you do know from the list below.
<p>Since a numeric entry such as 44001 might be a customer# or a zip code, Dynamo will list a customer with a Dynamo Customer# of 44001 as well as any customers with a zip code of 44001.&#160; When you know the customer#, you can enter a space after the customer# to bypass searching for matching zip codes, etc.&#160; For example, to select customer# 44001, and not display a list at all, enter 44001, then touch the space bar, then touch the Enter key.</p></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td nowrap="nowrap">Company Name</td>
                <td>Enter a few characters of the customer's 'Alphabetize by' field.&#160; Matching customers will be included in the list regardless of whether the entry is made in upper, lower, or mixed case.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td nowrap="nowrap">Contact Name</td>
                <td>You can enter a contact first name, i.e., <code>John</code>, their last name, i.e., <code>Smith</code>, or both names, i.e., <code>John Smith</code>.&#160; You can enter the contact name in upper, lower, or mixed case.&#160;&#160;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td nowrap="nowrap">Email Address</td>
                <td>You can enter a contact's email address.&#160; You can enter the email address in upper, lower, or mixed case.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td nowrap="nowrap">Phone#</td>
                <td>You can enter the company telephone number, or any contact's telephone number, with or without the area code.&#160; Since some area codes have changed, Dynamo will include in the list of matching customers, any phone# where the last 7 digits of the phone# match.&#160; This feature helps you to find customers where the area code in the Dynamo records has not yet been changed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td nowrap="nowrap">Zip Code</td>
                <td>You may enter the starting characters of US zip codes.&#160; For example entering 44001 will list all customers with a zip code of 44001, regardless of zip+4 value.&#160; Entering 441, will include all customers with a zip code that begins with 441.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td nowrap="nowrap">#+Invoice Number</td>
                <td>This option is most often used during Cash Receipts Entry when you know the invoice#, but not the Customer#.&#160; Entering a pound sign, followed by the invoice number will return the customer# that was billed for the invoice number entered, i.e. an entry of #12345 will return the customer that was billed invoice# 12345.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td nowrap="nowrap">F3=Help</td>
                <td>Select 'Item Level Help' to display this Help Text</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td nowrap="nowrap">F4=End</td>
                <td>Exit Item Search</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Since searching for customers can sometimes take a while, especially when many items match the entry, you can also touch the F4 key during the search process to abort the search process, and display the customers found so far.</p>
        <p>When multiple customers match the information entered, you will see a display similar to one of the examples below.&#160; In some cases, you will need to touch the ArrowRight key to view additional columns.</p>
        <p>Use the cursor movement keys to highlight the desired customer, then touch Enter.&#160; The cursor movement keys include: ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Home, End, PageUp and PageDown.</p>
        <p>In the following example, MARTHA was entered.&#160; There are matching customers with an Alpha of MARTHA as well as contacts names that contain MARTHA.</p>

        <p>After touching the Arrow Right key:</p>
        <p>
            <img border="0" src="CustSe2.jpg" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p>In the following example the entry was BILL COLE.&#160; Note that companies with a matching ALPHA and those with a matching CONTACT are displayed.</p>
