        <p>Dynamo uses a single data entry routine for all keyboard entries.&#160; This insures a consistent format, with a message displayed at the bottom of the display or window, with instructions and options for the operator.&#160; Although you won't read these messages once you get familiar with the programs, they are always there for your reference.</p>
        <p>Dynamo works best with a standard PC keyboard with 12 function keys, and 6 editing keys (Insert, Delete, Home, End, PageUp &amp; PageDn), and 4 arrow keys (ArrowLf, ArrowRt, ArrowUp and ArrowDn).&#160; These keyboards are also available on IBM 3151/3153, and Wyse 60/150/160 terminals.&#160; For keyboards that do not have all these keys, you can frequently accomplish the same function by holding down the Ctrl key while touching another key.&#160; The Ctrl key is much like Shift.&#160; By itself it does nothing, but when holding it down, the meaning of the next key touched changes.</p>
        <p>The Function keys, F1-F12, and Shift F1-F12 work as described below assuming the operator has not changed them from their operation using Terminal Function Key Maintenance (SMC).</p>
