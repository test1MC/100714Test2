        <p class="SectionDesc">Dynascan applications are designed to run on small computers that can be held in your hand, or even worn on your arm.&#160; These computers have the same type of wireless network connectivity as a laptop computer.&#160; Dynamo includes Dynascan applications for Purchase Order Receiving, Transfer Order Shipping &amp; Receiving, Order Picking, Order Packing, Item Put-Away, and Physical Inventory.&#160; The programs work much like the ones run on a full size workstation such as a PC, Mac, or thin-client, but the display dimensions are 24 columns by 16 rows, instead of 80/132 columns by 25 rows.&#160; Excellware is an authorized reseller of Motorola products including mobile computers, accessories, and wireless communication devices.</p>
        <p>This document is based on using the Wavelink terminal emulator that is included with the Motorola MC9000 series computers.&#160; Although tested on a Motorola MC9090 running Windows CE and Wavelink TelnetCE version 7.0.37, other versions of Windows and other terminal emulators can also be used.</p>
