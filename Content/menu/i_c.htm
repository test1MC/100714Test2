        <p>Dynamo supports Last-In-First-Out (LIFO), First-In-First-Out (FIFO), and 
Average costing methods.&#160; Dynamo is fully integrated with the General 
Ledger, which means that any time a transaction affects inventory, the General 
Ledger must change accordingly.&#160; For Sales Order Processing, inventory is 
adjusted during invoice update.&#160; The quantity on hand and general ledger 
are updated at the same time.&#160; For all other transactions that affect 
inventory, including Purchase Order Receiving, Transfer Order Shipping and 
Receiving, Inventory adjustments, Vendor Invoice Reconciliation, etc., the 
quantity on hand is adjusted immediately as the transaction is processed, and 
the general ledger posting is consolidated for an automated posting that takes 
place at the end of the day.&#160; This reduces the number of postings that 
affect the General Ledger.</p>
        <p>The General Ledger period must be open for sales order and inventory 
transactions in order to process a transaction for a specific date.&#160; Each 
General Ledger period is opened and closed using G/L Period Ending Date 
Maintenance on the GLU menu.</p>
        <p>Dynamo tracks each receipt of inventory individually.&#160; This includes 
each purchase order and transfer order receipt, as well as positive inventory 
adjustments when there are no prior receipts.&#160; Dynamo tracks the usage of 
inventory by receipt.&#160; This usage of each inventory receipt can be 
displayed using Item Inquiry.</p>
        <p>In order to insure the most accurate costing, Dynamo does not permit the 
quantity on hand of an item at a warehouse to go below zero.&#160; Product must 
be received before it can be sold.&#160; Sales orders can be entered, and even 
invoices printed, when there is no inventory for an item, but the invoice will 
not be updated until sufficient inventory exists for each item on the order.</p>
