        <h5>Getting Started</h5>
        <p>Before using the selections on the Purchase Order Processing Menu, you will 
need to complete the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Setup Vendors (VML menu)</li>
            <li>Setup Product Categories (IML)</li>
            <li>Setup Product Classes (IML)</li>
            <li>Setup Items (IML)</li>
            <li>Create G/L Account Numbers (G/L) for:<ul><li>Inventory (one or more accounts may be used)</li><li>Special Order Inventory (for purchase of items not on Item file)</li><li>Unvouchered Receipts (Liability like Accounts Payable)</li><li>Inventory Rounding Adjustment (Expense related to penny adjustments 
		due to discounts, multipliers, and costing units)</li><li>Vendor Returns Receivable (Asset account for merchandise returned to 
		vendor)</li><li>Vendor Rebates Receivable (Asset account for projected rebate issued 
		by vendor)</li></ul></li>
            <li>Use G/L Interface Maintenance (GLU) to indicate the G/L account numbers 
	that Dynamo should use for automated postings.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Upgrading</h5>
        <p>If you used a version of Dynamo Purchase Order Processing prior to 2007, you 
will notice that the current Dynamo version is radically different from what you 
are used to.&#160; But we hope that you will find that the current version is 
much easier to use and offers many features not previously available.&#160; 
Here are some of the significant differences.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The screen layout (we call them views) are much less cluttered, 
	typically with a single column of longer field descriptions, with data to 
	the right.</li>
            <li>There are more views, for example there are 3 separate heading views for 
	a purchase order.</li>
            <li>There are many changes to the detail section where line items are 
	entered:<ul><li>the line number is no longer visible</li><li>you can insert lines anywhere on the PO using the Insert key</li><li>you can delete a line item using the Delete key</li><li>you can scroll forwards and backwards within the line items</li><li>you can even search the line items for a particular item# or 
		description.&#160; This is especially useful for long purchase orders 
		with hundreds of line items.</li><li>the primary detail screen is uncluttered and shows only the basic 
		information: Item#, description lines, quantity ordered, cost, and 
		costing unit</li><li>you can access all other fields related to a line item using the 
		Properties option</li><li>you can enter a discount% or a multiplier</li><li>in addition to showing the extended cost, the extended weight and 
		cube are shown which can be helpful when placing a full trailer order</li><li>the message lines have been replaced with a Dynamo Notepad that is 
		linked to an item</li><li>you can specify a general ledger account number to be used when 
		purchasing products that are not for inventory</li></ul></li>
            <li>Timestamps are created for most activities</li>
            <li>You can transfer the line items from one PO to another</li>
            <li>You can jump over to Vendor Inquiry from Purchase Order Processing 
	without re-entering the Vendor#.</li>
            <li>You don't lose your position when selecting a PO from a list.&#160; The 
	highlight bar will move down to the next PO in the list.</li>
            <li>You can select from a list of POs based on a specific warehouse/store 
	code.</li>
            <li>Purchase Order Processing is no longer used for Receiving, a separate 
	menu selection is used.</li>
            <li>There are no longer any PO.</li>
            <li>Emailed POs now include an attached spreadsheet of line items purchased 
	to assist the vendor that imports a PO into their computer system.</li>
            <li>You no longer get messages like "PO in use at another terminal" and must 
	be "unlocked" by Excellware.</li>
            <li>One PO Receipt can include multiple purchase orders, and should whenever a 
	vendor ships products that were ordered on multiple POs together.</li>
            <li>PO receipts can be entered using a Workstation (PC, Mac, thin client), 
	using a tethered bar code reader (attached to a Workstation), or a hand-held 
	wireless computer with bar code scanner.</li>
            <li>PO receipts are updated individually and no longer in a batch.</li>
            <li>Dynamo will create a G/L posting for each receipt.&#160; Note that all 
	PO Receipts are consolidated into a single G/L posting that takes place just 
	after midnight each day.&#160; Dynamo will debit the G/L inventory account 
	(or other account specified in the PO Line Item Properties), and credit the 
	Unvouchered Receipts account.&#160; It is important to change your A/P 
	Invoice Data Entry procedure not to distribute invoices to the Inventory 
	account.&#160; Instead, all invoices for inventory purchases should debit 
	the Unvouchered Receipts account.</li>
            <li>Dynamo Accounts Payable is fully integrated with PO Receipts, so it is 
	important to enter the PO# whenever entering Vendor Invoices and select 
	from the list of open PO receipts for that PO.</li>
            <li>You can re-open a closed PO when you discover that the cost of an item 
	as shown on the PO differs from the vendor invoice.&#160; Dynamo will change 
	the cost of the received product.</li>
            <li>Dynamo will track the receipt of each item separately.&#160; Each 
	receipt and how the product received was used can be displayed in Item 
	Inquiry.</li>
            <li>Item Inquiry also will show the complete PO Receipt history of an item, 
	showing quantity and cost, with the most recent purchases first.</li>
            <li>Vendor Returns are no longer entered as a negative quantity on a 
	purchase order.&#160; There is a separate menu (VRP) to enter returns, print 
	packing slips, update the inventory, and post to the General Ledger the 
	reduction in inventory and Vendor Returns Receivable.</li>
            <li>There is no longer a need to "Reset the Quantity on Order."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thank you for upgrading Dynamo.&#160; We hope you enjoy the new features and 
find the programs easier to use and provide the information needed to make smart 
purchasing decisions.</p>
