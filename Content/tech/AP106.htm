        <p class="SectionDesc">This routine is used to determine invoiced amounts for a specific receipt.&#160; It also is used to determine the date that a receipt can be closed, i.e., the G/L posting date of the vendor invoice that completed charges for the receipt.</p>
        <p>It is called during A/P Invoice Data Entry to enable the operator to select the receipt or receipts that apply to the invoice.&#160; It is also called during A/P Invoice update to set the date that the receipt was closed, and by the Unvouchered Receipts Listing.</p>
