        <p class="SectionDesc">It is common practice in business—especially retail—to give discounts to certain customers. Discounts might be given if the customer purchases a large volume of products, has certain contracts in place, etc. Whatever the reason, Dynamo can provide custom price discounts on a per-customer basis. As opposed to a one off discount on a particular sales order or item, these types of customer-based discounts are intended to be given automatically whenever a customer places an order. </p>
        <p class="SectionDesc"> Dynamo users can create as many discount tiers as they like. However, having too many discount pricing schemes may get too complicated and cumbersome to manage down the line. For this reason, Excellware recommends a simpler, 3- to 5-tiered discount pricing structure. </p>

        <h5>Planning</h5>
        <p>A little planning can go a long way in setting up pricing discounts. This starts with setting up meaningful product categories in Dynamo and then creating product classes that fit neatly within those categories. As mentioned above, a discount pricing scheme with 5 or less tiers is recommended. For the following example, we will be using 3 discount tiers, or levels: Standard, Better, and Best.</p>
