                    <p>In some cases, the terms of sale allow for several payments to be made. Terms codes that designate these split payments may specify a particular day of the month on which payment is due.&#160;&#160;</p>

                    <p>Some terms allow monthly payments to be made on an invoice.&#160;In this case the Due field displays the time intervals at which payments should be made.&#160;&#160;</p>

                    </table>
                    <h6>Note in the previous examples that the Due column displays 30 Days for terms code of "Net 30" as well as for terms code of &#160; "Monthly Payments." &#160; In order to distinguish one from another, refer to the adjacent columns Pmts (Number of Payments) and Freq (Frequency of Payments) to interpret the Due column correctly. &#160; These are explained below. &#160;&#160;</h6>

        The LD field displays a day of the month which acts as a "cutoff" day.&#160;When the invoice date falls before this cutoff day, the due date/discount due date is bumped into the following month.&#160;&#160;

        The Frequency field is an alpha code that corresponds to the time intervals in which split payments are due. If the terms code indicates that only one payment will be made, this field is not applicable.&#160;&#160;

                    <p>Note: This column cannot be changed to "Y" for terms code 00 No Terms Established. It cannot be modified because there is no reason to assign a terms code of "no terms established" to a customer. This code is only used when a customer record does not contain a terms code.</p>

                <td>
                    <p>The C field is used for modifying the established Terms Codes.  You may change or delete a specific terms code by entering its 2 digit TC.  Use the Enter key to move from column to column and override the established entries.</p>
                    <p>You will be given the option of displaying a schedule of examples by pressing Enter after the PMTS column (or FREQ if applicable). &#160;Using specific months and days, the examples demonstrate how the terms code affects due dates and payments in relation to the invoice date.</p>
                    <h6>To add a new Terms Code:</h6>
                    <p>Choose a 2 digit code that is not being used for the established codes (For example, to add Net 100 days you may want to choose code 12). The prompts at the bottom of the screen will guide you in setting up this new terms code.</p>
