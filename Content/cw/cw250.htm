        <p class="SectionDesc"> Use this program to edit the tracking number of a particular order. If you have a scanner, you can scan the bar code on the billing copy of a shipment to get the number. Otherwise, enter the number listed below the bar code. The rest of the information will automatically fill in, but you can edit it if necessary. After completing or updating the information in this application, the PRO/Tracking# will be displayed when viewing this sales order in Sales&#160;Order Inquiry.</p>

Less often, but still feasible, a company will have the shipping charges billed to the customer's account with the shipper [(R) Recipient]. For third party billing (T,) see below for details.</td>
