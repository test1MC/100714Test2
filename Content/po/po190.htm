        <p>To print a receiving document, use this application. A receiving document is given to someone who has not yet received items from a particular purchase. </p>
        <p>The document will display the receipt number (only if you choose to print the receiving document for a receipt and not for a purchase order), the purchase order number, the vendor, the warehouse, the page number, and the "printed on" date displayed in the first row. </p>
        <p>The second row is left intentionally blank so these headings can be filled i: received by, received on, entered by, entered on. Below the second row, the quantity received, item number, item description, package quantity, and location will be listed for all items ordered. </p>
        <p>The operator must:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>specify if the document is for a purchase order (P) or a receipt (R). </li>
            <li>enter the receipt number/purchase order number&#160;(the vendor will automatically fill in).</li>
            <li>enter the desired sequence.</li>
        </ol>
