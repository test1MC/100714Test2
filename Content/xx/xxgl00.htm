                    <p>Account numbers can be up to 9 digits in length (including locations if applicable) and divided into one, two, or three segments. &#160; Enter the numbers of digits in each of these segments. If an account number does not require the 2nd or 3rd segment, enter a zero for those segments.</p>
                    <p>Typically the first segment identifies the primary account while the second segment identifies locations or branches. (The length of this second segment is determined by the number of locations. &#160; For example, a 2-digit segment will accommodate up to 99 locations.) &#160; A third segment could be used to identify departments within that location.</p>
                    <p>In order to produce financial reports by location, these additional segments are essential.</p>
                    <p>Once you have defined the structure of your account numbers, the account numbers and description can be set up in G/L Account Maintenance.&#160;</p>
