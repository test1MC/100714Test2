                <td>First of all, let's define what Dynamo means by Alternate Item#. It is not an equivalent or substitute item#. An Alternate Item# is used in the following situations:
									<ol><li>You have two item numbers that may have different descriptions or pricing, but refer to the same physical product. In this case, set the Alternate Item# to that Item# which has the physical product.&#160;Another example would be if you purchase a product from multiple vendors and want to have different descriptions, yet the products are homogenous, meaning that once they are placed on the shelf together, you can't tell them apart.&#160;Certain generic pipe and fittings might fall into this category.</li><li>You sell an item in different package quantities and want to use different item numbers for each package quantity. For example, lets say you typically sell Item# PROD4 by the carton and each carton contains 4 one-gallon bottles.&#160;You prefer to sell unbroken cartons, but will sell an individual bottle when requested.&#160;The individual bottle is item# PROD1. You always purchase cartons and your vendor considers quantity 1 to mean 1 carton of 4 bottles. If the vendor sold these by the gallon, then an alternate item would not be needed.&#160;So the quantity on hand for item# PROD4 is the number of cartons, and the quantity on hand for item# PROD1 is the number of loose bottles from broken cartons.&#160;In this example, Item# PROD1 should have an Alternate Item# of PROD4, with an Alternate Item Transfer Qty of 4, because there are 4 PROD1's in each PROD4. If a sales order is entered for item# PROD1, and you do not have enough of Item# PROD1 to fill the order, Dynamo will automatically remove one PROD4 item from inventory, and add quantity 4 of item PROD1 to inventory so the order may be filled.&#160;This eliminates the need for the warehouse staff to record the fact that they broke a carton to sell less than a carton quantity.&#160; We call that an Automated Transfer from Alternate. At physical inventory time you will count the number of full cartons (item# PROD4), and the number of loose gallons (item# PROD1).&#160;</li></ol></td>
