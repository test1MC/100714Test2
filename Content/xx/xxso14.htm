        <p class="SectionDesc">This application is used to manage all settings related to sales tax calculation.</p>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Single rate applied to entire state</li>
            <li>Multiple rates in state based on type of product, i.e., Illinois has different rates for sales, rental, and repairs</li>
            <li>Destination based or single rate for Ohio</li>
            <li>Date based rates so new rates can be entered in advance</li>
            <li>Option to charge sales tax on shipping (Ohio started the practice in August 2003)</li>
            <li>Branch specific tax calculation, i.e., internet sales branch using single state-wide rate, where branch in state uses product based rates</li>
            <li>Automatic updating of Ohio destination based sales tax rates.&#160; Do not 
enter any Ohio county based rates.</li>
            <li>Support for 4 counties in central Ohio, Delaware, Fairfied, Licking, &amp; Union 
counties, where part of the county is charged one tax rate, and the part of the 
county serviced by the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) is charged another 
rate.</li>
            <li>G/L Account# for sales tax liability can vary by state, type of product, etc.</li>
            <li>Sales Tax report that includes Ohio's State Identifier numbers and not the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).&#160; For example the FIPS number for Cuyahoga County is 35 but Ohio uses a different State Identifier# of 18.&#160; This report makes it easier to enter your monthly sales tax figures online.</li>
            <li>Creation of a file in the format required by Ohio for monthly upload of sales tax data, reducing entry errors and time to process.</li>
        </ol>
        <h6>
            <p>Note: Only enter states that you charge sales tax.&#160; Any state not listed will not be charged tax.&#160; 
Ohio destination rates do not need to be entered here.&#160; They can be 
downloaded automatically every month to insure latest rates are always in place.</p>
        </h6>
        <h6>
            <p>Note: When making any rate change, you must re-enter all branch records with 
the new effective date, even if there are no rate changes for other records for 
the same branch.</p>
        </h6>
        <p>Example below would be a simple yet typical configuration for an Ohio company, with no out-of-state offices, that wants to charge Destination based sales tax to Ohio customers.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Example below describes a company that wants to charge a single fixed rate to customers in Ohio 
with shipping taxed, and also a fixed rate to customers in Pennsylvania with 
shipping not taxed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="xxso14-2.png" style="width: 725px;height: 424px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Example below describes a more complex situation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shipments to Ohio or customer pickup from Ohio stores will be charged Ohio destination based sales tax.</li>
            <li>Shipments from internet branch J Illinois are charged a single interstate 
rate unless shipped to Ohio.</li>
            <li>Sales from branch R located in Illinois are taxed at one of three operator selected rates for sales, rental, or repair items.&#160; Note that you should not mingle different types of products on the same invoice as Dynamo only supports one sales tax rate per invoice.&#160; </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="xxso14-3.png" style="width: 725px;height: 424px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The Sales Tax State, Tax Identifier, description, and rate are all displayed on the 'Shipping Info' view of the Sales Order.&#160; 
This example is for an Ohio destination based shipment to a Summit county 
address.</p>
