        <p>Vendor Invoice Reconciliation is used when a balance difference occurs between a receipt and a vendor's invoice. Once a purchase order receipt has been updated, if the invoiced value has been determined to be correct, the operator can utilize this application to reconcile the difference (note that invoice amounts cannot be changed using A/P Invoice Maintenance). For example, if an item with a quantity of one was received for $100 and the vendor invoice is $105 for the item, the receipt value can be 'reconciled' with this application. The receipt will then indicate the item cost $105 instead of $100. With this application, the operator can also view listings of the items and correct any with variances to reconcile the differences.</p>
