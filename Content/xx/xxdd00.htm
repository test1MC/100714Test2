		converted programs are retained for future use, you can eliminate the 
		time required for program conversion by saving programs in BBj tokenized 
		format in a special directory.&#160;For example, Dynamo stores programs 
		in bbx format in the DY/ folder, and the same program is saved in BBj 
		format in the DY/BBj/ folder. If an entry is made in this BBj 
		Prefix field, and you are running BBj, either by menu, stored procedure,

                        <p>The prefix consists of the following segments:</p>

		the Dynamo Tools install directory (SMSDIR) is included next in the

		the Dynamo Tools menu, the prefix at the time CDS000 is called by the 
		other menu application is included next in the prefix.</li>

		Control#, <code>"L"+STR(LCN:"00000")</code> exists, then this is 
		included next in the prefix.</li>
                            <li>The active company code XX/ is next.&#160; This entry will include 
		the data server prefix when the Dynamo Tools install directory is across 
		the data server.</li>
                            <li>If running BBj, then CD/BBj/ is next (plus data server prefix when 
		applicable)</li>
                            <li>If the active company code is not CD, then CD/ is next (plus data 
		server prefix when applicable)</li>
                            <li>Any prefix specified using Menu Maintenance for the active menu is 
		next.</li>
                            <li>If the BBj Prefix described above is non-blank, it is next.</li>
                            <li>Finally the company specific Prefix specified here is next.</li>

                        <p>Note that after the prefix is built, any parenthetic reference, i.e., 
		(MYGLOBAL) is replaced with the value of the global variable name 
		specified between the parentheses.</p>
                        <p>Note that the above prefix sequence is applicable when running the 
		Dynamo Tools menu.&#160;Applications that do not use the Dynamo Tools 
		menu, but use CDS011, including background tasks, Dynaweb, BBj stored 
		procedures, triggers, etc. only use prefix segment numbers 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10
