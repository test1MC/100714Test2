        <p>Buyer Maintenance is used to create or maintain information about people who are authorized to place purchase orders. Typically, a vendor is assigned a buyer. The buyer that a vendor is assigned to can be maintained in <a href="xxvm01.htm">Vendor Maintenance</a>. The buyer is then referenced on a purchase order to indicate who placed the order. </p>

In order to differentiate between local and long distance phone numbers, use the area code only when different from your own. For long distance calls within your area code, use the 1 prefix. Do not specify the area code for local calls. Any foreign telephone# number (other then Canada) may be entered up to 12 characters in length including spaces.</p><p>When entering the telephone number, eliminate the hyphens; the program will insert them for you.</p></td>
