        <p>Dynamo supports integrated credit card processing with card processors First Data and authorize.net. Although the First Data Legacy Global Gateway is still supported, First Data is phasing out this gateway. Contact Excellware to make the switch to the First Data e4 Gateway, and save some credit card processing fees.</p>
        <p>The parameters shown below are obtained from the card processors merchant web site as indicated below. You will need the web site login and password to obtain these parameters.</p>
        <p>Note that you specify which card processor you use in <a href="xxso55.htm">Payment Method Maintenance</a> located on the ARU&#160;menu. Although typically companies will use the same processor for each card type, Dynamo does allow the card processor to vary by card type, i.e., MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover, etc. </p>
