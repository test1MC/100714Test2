        <p class="SectionDesc">This application is used to maintain Payment Method Codes used during entry of Payments in Sales Order Processing, and Point of Sale Order Processing.&#160;Payment Method Codes are used at the point of sale to identify the payment method(s) being applied to an order. Common payment methods include check, credit card, gift card, PayPal, cash (or cash equivalent), though the list of options is user-maintained and can therefore be customized to fit each company's specific requirements.</p>

                    <p>For credit cards, the operator will need to specify if the processing is integrated, and if so, which gateway is being used. If you have different cards that use different gateways, you can select a different gateway for each card. For instance, in the image above, the non-integrated choice was selected for the American Express card. It was enabled for American Express by typing "Y" for that choice and "N" for Visa, MasterCard, and Discover. If you use the First Data Global Gateway e4 for your Discover card, you would select your Discover card payment method and enable it with "Y"&#160;for Discover and "N" for all other choices. </p>
