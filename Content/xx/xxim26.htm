        <p>This program allows the operator to create and edit product categories to be used within&#160;Dynamo. Product categories are used to group similar items or to separate dissimilar items. Product Categories are typically broad classifications that describe the types of items your company sells or the services it provides. </p>

                        <p>The Product Category type is used to differentiate non-traditional type sales from regular sales. The available types are (C)&#160;Costed, (U) Uncosted, and (O)&#160;Other.</p>
                        <p>&#160;</p>
                        <p><strong>Costed</strong> is used for regular or costed sales, where there is a cost associated with the sale. Sales are typically costed. </p>
                        <p>&#160;</p>
                        <p><strong>Uncosted</strong> is used for sales without cost associated with them. Some examples are rentals, labor, and delivery charges (if billed as a line item in Sales Order Processing (SOP)). Entering a 'U' will indicate that sales under this product category should be recorded separately from regular sales. </p>
                        <p>&#160;</p>
                        <p><strong>Other</strong> is used for other sales, a catch-all type for any sale that may not qualify as costed or uncosted. One example is the sale of a gift card. Like uncosted sales, the sale of these items should be recorded separately from regular or costed sales.</p>
