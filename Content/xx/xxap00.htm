                        <p>      The regular check stub has enough space to list up to 39 lines of invoice numbers. If variables such as Note or Discount apply to a check, the stub will not be able to accommodate 39 invoices since the additional information will take up stub space. If a check is being issued for more than 39 invoices, a full-page remittance list (an extended stub) can be printed.</p>
                        <p>Entering "Y" at this field indicates that a remittance advice attachment will automatically print when necessary. After the checks have printed, the operator will receive a prompt on the screen to insert blank sheets of paper into the printer on which the extended stub will print. If operators require extended stubs regularly, Excellware, Inc.&#160; recommends enabling this option so that check forms will not be voided unnecessarily (refer to "N" option).</p>
                        <p>Entering "N" indicates that the business rarely requires the remittance list feature. Note that if an operator enters "N" and at some point in the future requires a remittance list for a check, the first check form will be voided and its stub will be used to print the first 39 invoices. &#160; The remaining invoices and check will then print on the check form that follows.</p>

                        <p>If the location of these fields needs to be adjusted for some reason (such as needing a more precise fit to a company's window envelopes), adjust the default column and row numbers, keeping in mind that the numbers represent dots. There are 300 dots to an inch. Columns are measured from the left edge of the paper. Rows are measured from the top of the check (not the paper).</p>

                        <p>For example, if the "Payee Name and Address" needs to be moved up slightly (let's say about 1/10"), the number of dots in the row needs to be reduced. &#160; In this case, the operator would reduce the row number by 30 dots. If the "Payee Name and Address" also needed to be moved slightly to the left, the operator would reduce the number of dots in column since the number of dots are a measurement taken from the left of the paper.</p>
