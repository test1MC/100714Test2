        <p class="SectionDesc">Sales Order/Invoice Inquiry is used to display an order or invoice previously entered into the system. This program displays the order/invoice but permits no changes.</p>
        <p>An order or invoice may be displayed if you know either the order number, the customer number, alpha sort name, phone number, or zip code. In addition, the operator can 'scroll' through the open orders, i.e., display them one after the other in order number sequence.</p>
        <p>If the operator enters only the customer number or name, key information about the order is displayed in the following format: SEQ, ORD NUM, B, W, S, P.O.NUMBER, ORDER DATE, ORDER VALUE, INV DATE, INV NUMBER, INV TOTAL.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Then the operator may enter a sequence number, i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc. in order to display that particular order. After the selected order is displayed, the next order for that customer can be displayed without re-entering the customer number or making another selection. This<br />
  method is used to 'scroll' through all open orders for a particular customer.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The heading information for the order is displayed first. This includes the total order value for all orders, and the subtotal, sales tax amount (if any), shipping charges, and total invoice amount for any orders that have been invoiced. Hitting 'Enter' will display the complete screen of detail lines. If there are more line items, the operator has the option to either 'scroll' through these lines or terminate the display.</p>
