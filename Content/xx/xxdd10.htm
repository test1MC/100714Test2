        Dynamo typically uses a 6 character file name that starts with the two character company code.&#160; The data dictionary should only include that portion of the file name that follows the company code.&#160; In this example, the file name is DSCM01, the company code is DS, so only CM01 is needed here.&#160; You may store files with names up to 
		10 characters long (excluding the 2 character company code).<br /><br /> Data Dictionary Maintenance can also be used for describing other data structures that are used to store data and transfer between programs.&#160; The Dat Dictionary Name field would often refer to the string variable name used (excluding the trailing 
		dollar sign).&#160; For example, program CM040 has a data structure used to pass information to and back from CM040.&#160; The File Name field in that example would be CM040.&#160; The company used to store the Data Dictionary for program templates should be the same as the folder where the program is located.&#160; In this example, the CM040 program is located in the DY/ directory, so company DY should be used to store the Data Dictionary.

        <p>&#160;</p><p>Temporary work files should also be described in the Data Dictionary.&#160; Temporary files are designated using a period following the Data Dictionary Name.&#160; The CM040 program, for example, creates a work file.&#160; This work file has a data dictionary file name of CM040. (including the period at the end).&#160; 
		No other periods may appear in the Data Dictionary Name.</p></td>

        <p><br />        Field names in the format FSn where n is a number have special significance in Dynamo Tools.&#160; They indicate that the field represents a field separator, used in files that still use an IOLIST for reading and writing data.&#160; In the example above FS1 is the first field separator in the record.&#160; Note that the NAME field is variable length and does not have an FS2 field following it.&#160; This is because the NAME field truly is variable in length, where the CUSTNO field is always 6 characters long, and thus requires a template type of C(6) and not C(6*).</p><p>It is our recommendation, that any new file use fixed length fields, and no field separators.&#160; The CVS() function can be used to strip trailing blanks from fields when required.</p></td>

        This is the bbx template type.&#160; A character type is assumed, so an entry of 10 will display as C(10).&#160; An entry of 10* will display as C(10*).&#160; An entry of N5 will display as N(5).&#160; The * indicates variable length, but unlike bbx, Dynamo assumes the number before the * is the maximum length of the field.

        <p><br />       For new files, we recommend using fixed length field types.&#160; The CVS() function can be used to strip trailing blanks from fields when required.&#160; We also recommend using B type fields for all numeric fields that have fractional places such as any field containing amounts of dollars and cents.</p><p>We also suggest using U(3) fields for all dates, and storing the date in the julian format.&#160; The DATE() function can be used when required to format this internal date value.&#160; However, the Dynamo Data Dictionary will support dates in C(8) format: MM/DD/YY, C(6)/N(6) format: YYMMDD, N(5) format using the Microsoft serial# date, or C(8)/N(8) format: YYYYMMDD.</p><p>Note that unlike bbx that uses -1 as the julian date value for a field without a date, and 0 to indicate today's date, Dynamo considers a date with a value of 0 as a field without a date.&#160; This definition eliminates the need to populate newly dimensioned string templates containing date fields with -1 values.</p></td>

        <p>This option is used to define or convert an existing data file to match the current Data Dictionary. It is essentially the same as the Compare to Data Dictionary Option withing the File Utility (SMU), but also available here for convenience.</p>
        <p>Note that when it is necessary to rename an existing field in a data file that has records, it is best to use the Data Dictionary File/Field Rename application on the FMS&#160;menu, as it will also change the template file.</p>

        <p>This option is used to export the Dynamo Tools Data Dictionary for the current Data Dictionary Name, to the Basis Legacy Data Dictionary. This eliminates the need to manually maintain the Basis Data Dictionary using the Basis Enterprise Manager. This function is the same as the 'Update Basis Data Dictionary from Dynamo Data Dictionary' option in the 'Basis Data Dictionary Maintenance' application on the FMS&#160;menu, but also available here for convenience.</p>
