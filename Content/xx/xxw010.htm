        <p class="SectionDesc">Purchase Order Inquiry is used to display a purchase order previously entered into the system. This program displays the purchase order but permits no changes.</p>
        <p>A purchase order may be displayed if you know either the order number, the vendor number, alpha sort name, phone number, or zip code. In addition, the operator can 'scroll' through the open orders, i.e., display them one after the other in order number sequence.</p>
        <p>Entering the Purchase Order number in the Order# field and pressing ENTER will display the Purchase Order Heading Screen.&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <h6>Purchase Order Detail</h6>
        <p>From the Heading Screen, pressing ENTER will display the Order Detail Screen, Pressing S will display the Time Stamp, and pressing F4 will scroll to the next Purchase Order on file.</p>
        <p>If the Purchase Order Number is not known, pressing the SpaceBar will move the cursor to a field where vendor number, alpha sort name, phone number, or zip code can be entered.&#160; If the operator enters only the vendor number or name, key information about the order is displayed in the following format: SEQ, ORD NUM, W, S, ORDER DATE, ORDER VALUE, REFERENCE, CUSTOMER NUMBER, and SHIP TO ADDRESS.</p>
        <p>Then the operator may enter a sequence number, i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc. in order to display that particular order. After the selected order is displayed, the next order for that vendor can be displayed without re-entering the vendor number or making another selection. This method is used to 'scroll' through all open orders for a particular vendor.</p>
        <p>The heading information for the order is displayed first. This includes the total order value for all orders, and the received and last receipt information if the order has been received. Pressing 'Enter' will display the complete screen of detail lines. If there are more line items, the operator has the option to either 'scroll' through these lines or terminate the display.</p>
