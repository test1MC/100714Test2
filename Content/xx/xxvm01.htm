        <p>When a vendor such as a payroll service provides a file which can be 
	imported into Dynamo Manual Payment Entry, the fields on this view are used 
	to indicate which columns in the import file are used for each field. The 
	G/L Account# and Amount columns are required.&#160;The Payment Date and 
	Payment# columns are optional and only needed when the import file contains 
	multiple payments.&#160;Some payroll services process a payment for net 
	checks separately from payroll taxes. By treating these two payments 
	separately, each payment amount will match up properly during Bank 
	Reconciliation.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note that in some cases, the import file received from the vendor is not in a suitable format for automated importing.  Dynamo supports a pre-processor routine which can be used to convert the file received from the vendor into a compatible format. For example, the pre-processor routine could split the transaction into multiple payments, as might be required when a payroll service impounds multiple amounts from your bank account(e.g. for net checks, taxes, retirement, wage garnishments, etc.</p>
