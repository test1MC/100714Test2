        <p class="SectionDesc">This application is used to change the password for the operator that is currently logged in.</p>
        <p>Consider passwords of two words separated by a special character such as 'break*dance' or 'smoky#hill'.</p>
        <p>Although passwords are not required to be changed at some frequency by default, Excellware can enforce a password aging policy which would require operators to use this application to change their password at a frequency determined by your company policy.</p>
        <p>Note that this program may complain that the password is too simple, or based on a dictionary word, etc.&#160; Add a number, an upper case character, or a special character to prevent this type of message.</p>
