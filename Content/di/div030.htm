        <p>Cash Receipts Application is used to apply deposited checks to the appropriate account or to specific invoices. The application displays information about the receipts. The operator can enter the line number or the invoice number to edit any balances. The operator can also use the space bar to scroll down on the listing. With this application, the operator can apply credit memos or write off finance charges. If a customer made a mistake on a payment, the operator can use this application to either write off the mistake or record that it was made in order to request an update on a payment. Non-receivable cash such as refunds or rebates can be recorded here as well. </p>
