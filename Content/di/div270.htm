        <p>Display Accounts Receivable Ageing is used to view company totals of accounts receivable information. It shows the due date of invoices in 30-day increments, the subtotal before finance charges are applied, the finance charges, and then the overall total owed to the company. It also displays the General Ledger Account associated with accounts receivable, listing any discrepancy between that account and the Accounts Receivable Detail. </p>
