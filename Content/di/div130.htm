        <p>Audit Customer A/R&#160;Control&#160;Totals is used to verify whether or not invoices add up to the customer control total. If these two are not balanced, this application prints the information. An operator may need to run this program if the power went out, the computer locked up, or any other technical issues occurred during a Cash Receipts Update. If a Cash Receipts&#160;Update has been interrupted, Audit Customer A/R&#160;Control Totals may display that the total does not agree with the sum of the detailed transaction. If this is the case, the operator can view the print-out and then run <a href="div140.htm">Reset Customer A/R&#160;Control&#160;Totals</a>. </p>
