        <p>In this program, the operator records customer payments. </p>

        </p>
        <p>The operator must enter:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the customer name</li>
            <li>the date the check was received</li>
            <li>the check number</li>
            <li>the check amount</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If all checks were received on the same day, enter one date upon opening the application. If you are entering checks that were received on multiple dates, use the space bar to enter separate dates for each check. Note that it is important to enter the correct date the check was received, not deposited, so that&#160;Dynamo can accurately calculate the customer's average time to pay after an invoice has been sent.</p>
        <p>Upon completion of this application, the operator can use the <a href="div041.htm">Cash Receipts Listing &amp;&#160;Deposit Ticket</a> application. The checks and the deposit ticket can then be taken to the bank. Please view our <a href="../ap/order_deposit_tickets.htm">deposit ticket guidelines</a> that describe which deposit tickets are compatible with Dynamo. </p>
