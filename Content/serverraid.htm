        <p class="SectionDesc">With the significant increase in disc capacities and reduction in disc drive costs, Excellware frequently recommends server configurations that include multiple disc drives.&#160; A concept known as RAID writes the same data to more than one drive, so that if one drive fails, the server can still operate.</p>
        <p>In RAID 0+1, there are two disc drives, and the same data is written to each drive.&#160; The following steps can be followed to a) verify that the data is in fact being written to each drive and the drives contain the same data, and b) to re-synchronize the drives should the data not be the same.&#160; These steps will take several hours to run.</p>
